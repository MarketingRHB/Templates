## Obsidian Help

### Start here

Hi there! I’m a note in your vault.

At the same time, I’m also just a Markdown file sitting on your hard disk. It’s all in plain text, so you don’t need to
worry about losing me in case [Obsidian] disappears one day.

## Quick Start

If you’re in a hurry, here’s some quick places to dive in

```
The [Command palette] contains most of the commands you need to work with Obsidian. Just press
CtrlCmd-P and start typing.

How to use Markdown to [Format your notes]
How to [embed files], or embed other notes
[Use hotkeys]
How to [[Working with multiple notesopen multiple files side by side]]
Obsidian can be extended with [[Core pluginsplugins]]. Several are available by default, and can be
enabled or disabled according to your needs.
```
If you want a more thorough introduction, including a bit about our philosophy, check out [Obsidian].

And if you’d like a gentle introduction, or just want to get started but don’t know how, head over to [Basic note
taking].

If you are a Catalyst supporter, and want to turn on Insider Builds, see [Insider builds].

## Workflows

Obsidian is a tool that can be used in many ways, from a simple list of notes to a very powerful knowledge
management system. We suggest you start at your own pace, and build it into the tool you need.

Here are a few ways to get started

If you want to just start taking notes, check out [Basic note taking]

If you already have a collection of notes in markdown format, just choose them for your Vault. Choose “Vault” in
the lower left and select the directory your notes are in.

If you have notes from Roam Research, Notion, or other systems, [[Import datahere’s how to import them]].


If you’d like to know more about Obsidian, you can [[Obsidianread about our story]].

By the way, you can feel free to edit these help docs, but when you open it again, they will be overwritten. So,
don’t put anything in them you want to keep.

## I have questions.

Then you should join our community!. We have active Discord and Forums, and the community is generally quite
helpful.

### Advanced topics

##### HTML sanitization

Obsidian sanitizes html for security reasons. Because it runs locally, scripting vulnerabilities are a more serious
problem than they would be in a web applications. Accordingly, we are probably a bit more strict than you may be
used to, and you may run into issues if you try to do things like embedding script tags in a note. However,
the vast majority of people will never encounter issues with this.

##### Accepted file formats

Obsidian recognizes the following file formats right now

```
1. Markdown files md ;
```
```
2. Image files png , jpg , jpeg , gif , bmp , svg ;
```
```
3. Audio files mp3 , webm , wav , m4a , ogg , 3gp , flac ;
```
```
4. Video files mp4 , webm , ogv ;
```
```
5. PDF files pdf.
```
All these types of files can be [[Embed filesembedded]] in a note.

##### Community plugins

Obsidian allows developers to write community plugins to extend Obsidian’s functionality.

Right now, the plugin API is in alpha status. This means any part of the API could introduce breaking changes in a
future release.

### For developers

For instructions on creating new plugins, see our sample plugin.

For documentation on the API, check out our plugin API repo.


After you created your plugin, you can add it to our community plugin marketplace by creating a pull request in
our releases repo. Refer to the sample plugin on how to release updates for your plugin.

### For users

##### Safe Mode

By default, Obsidian has Safe Mode turned on to protect you from potential harm. Under Safe Mode, no
community plugin will run.

Please be aware that community plugins can access files on your computer, connect to the internet, and even
install additional programs. To read more about plugin security, [[#Plugin securitysee here]].

In order to install community plugins, you need to turn off Safe Mode in Settings - Community plugin - Safe
Mode.

##### Discover and install community plugins

After disabling Safe Mode, you can find community plugins created by the community in Settings - Community
plugin - Community plugins - Browse.

On this page, you can browse plugins by popularity, or search for specific plugins. Click on a plugin to see details
and instruction from the plugin author. In the details page, you can click “Install” to install a plugin.

After installing, you can then find the installed plugins under Settings - Community plugin. They need to be
enabled in order to take effect. You can also uninstall them there.

### Plugin security

Thanks for trusting Obsidian with your data! It means a lot to us, and we take security very seriously. That
includes community plugins too.

Due to technical reasons with our platform, we’re unable to restrict plugins to a specific permission or access
level. Since we offer Obsidian for free, currently we’re unable to manually review each plugin.

The good news is that Obsidian has an amazing and passionate community, so we rely on community trust to
ensure security of community plugins.

In general, you should be able to trust most of the popular plugins from the community. We require all community
community plugins to be open sourced on GitHub. If you’re working with sensitive data, we recommend you
to inspect the plugin code before installing it, so that your security needs are met. You can find a link to the
plugin repository on the plugin detail page.

If you find any security flaws with community plugins, contact the plugin author by adding an issue on GitHub. If
you believe the plugin is malicious, contact us to get the plugin investigated and removed.

##### Insider builds


Insider builds are experimental versions of Obsidian that are released to Catalyst license owners, on an opt-in
basis.

Please note that insider builds are less stable than public versions, so if you prefer a smoother version, you don’t
have to enable it.

### How to enable insider build

If you are a [[Catalyst licenseCatalyst supporter]], you have access to Insider Builds before the general public.

### Report issues

If you’re on our Discord server, you can go to the #insider-build channel to report issues. If you’re filing a bug
report on the forum, be sure to note the version you’re using, so that we can improve it before rolling it out to
everyone.

##### Drag and Drop

There are many ways to drag and drop things around Obsidian to make the experience smoother

### Drag panes

See [[Working with multiple notes#5 Panes can be rearranged by draggingdragging panes]]

### Drag sources

```
You can drag a file, or multiple files from the [file explorer].
```
```
You can drag a file from a [search] result.
```
```
You can drag a file from [backlinks] or unlinked references.
```
```
You can drag a file from the [starred notes].
```
```
You can drag a file from a link inside the note, in preview mode.
```
### Drop destinations

```
You can drop a file on a pane header to open the file there. Hold Alt (or Shift on MacOS) to drop
anywhere on the pane.
```
```
You can drop a file on a folder in the [file explorer] to move the file there.
```
```
You can drop a file into an editor to inser t it as a link. The generated link also follows your preferences,
such as relative paths, or using markdown links.
```

```
You can drop a file on the [starred notes] to star it.
```
### Dragging from outside Obsidian

```
You can drag any HTML content from the browser into Obsidian to automatically conver t them into
Markdown
```
```
You can drag and drop any files from your native file explorer to have Obsidian impor t (make a copy of)
those files in your vault’s attachment folder and insert them as internal links. Hold Ctrl to create
file absolute links to those files instead of importing a copy.
```
### Dropping files outside Obsidian

```
This will create an obsidian URL in the external application for the Obsidian note that you dragged.
```
##### Contributing to Obsidian

Thanks for the interest in contributing to Obsidian!

There are three major ways you can contribute

### 1. Financial contribution

##### Commercial license

If you’d like to use Obsidian for work activities, try to let your work get you a [[Commercial licensecommercial
license]].

##### Add-on services

If you’d like to make a website from your notes, consider getting [Obsidian Publish] if the price works for you.

If you’re interested in an end-to-end encryption syncing solution, we also offer [Obsidian Sync]. In addition to
end-to-end encryption, Obsidian Sync also comes with version history.

##### Catalyst

If you don’t need any of the above, you can get a [Catalyst license] to support our developer, which also gives
you access to [Insider builds].

##### Obsidian Unlimited

For those very passionate about the project, there’s also the Obsidian Unlimited option, which lets you pay as
much as you want to support development and help us stay independent. We recommend going for this option
after you’ve purchased the VIP tier of [Catalyst license] so that you can enjoy the benefits.

### 2. Extending Obsidian


##### CSS themes

If you’re proficient in CSS, another way is to contribute a theme, so that people who don’t know CSS can enjoy
your work. If you decide to do so, feel free to share it on the #css-themes channel on Discord, or in the Share &
Showcase category on our forum.

If you’d like to add your theme to the community theme list, let us know! (Or we might reach out to you first!)

##### Plugins

If you’re a JavaScriptTypeScript programmer, you can write [Community plugins] for Obsidian, now that our
plugin API is in alpha.

### 3. Translation and proofreading

##### Translating the inter face

If you know another language (preferably natively), you can help with translating the Obsidian interface into your
language. You can do that by submitting a pull request in our translation GitHub repository to get it into the next
version of the app.

##### Translating the docs

We’re in the middle of reorganizing and stabilizing the documentation you’re reading right now. Once it’s in a
good shape, you can also help translate it, so that people who don’t know English can also easily learn to use
Obsidian.

##### Found a typo

If you found a typo or a grammar mistake in these documentation, feel free to submit a pull request in our
documentation repository.

##### Using obsidian URI

Obsidian supports a custom URI protocol obsidian which can be used to trigger various actions within the
app. This is commonly used on MacOS and mobile apps for automation and cross-app workflows.

If you have Obsidian installed, this link will open the app on your device Click here

## Installing Obsidian URI

To m a ke s u re yo u r o p e r a t i n g sys t e m re d i re c t obsidian URIs to the Obsidian app, there may be additional
steps you need to perform.

```
On Windows, running the app once should be sufficient. This will register for the obsidian custom
protocol handler in the Windows registry.
```

```
On MacOS, running the app once should be sufficient, however, your app must be installer version 0.8.
or later.
```
```
On Linux, there’s a much more involved process
```
```
First, ensure you create a obsidian.desktop file. See here for details
```
```
Ensure that your desktop file specifies the Exec field as Exec=executable %u. The %u is used
to pass the obsidian URIs to the app.
```
```
If you’re using the AppImage installer, you may have to unpack it using Obsidian-x.y.z.AppImage
--appimage-extract. Then make sure the Exec directive points to the unpacked executable.
```
## Using Obsidian URIs

Obsidian URIs are typically in this format

```
obsidianactionparam1=value&param2;=value
```
```
The action is usually the action that you would like to perform.
```
### Encoding

==Important==

Ensure that your values are properly URI encoded. For example, forward slash characters  must be encoded
as %2F and space characters must be encoded as %.

This is especially important because an improperly encoded “reserved” character may break the interpretation of
the URI. See here for details

### Available actions

##### Action open

Description Opens an Obsidian vault, and possibly open a file within that vault.

Possible parameters

```
vault can be either the vault name, or the vault ID.
```
```
The vault name is simply the name of the vault folder.
```
```
The vault ID is the random 16-character code assigned to the vault. This ID is unique per folder on
your computer. Example ef6ca3e3b524d22f. There isn’t an easy way to find this ID yet, one will
be offered at a later date in the vault switcher. Currently it can be found in
```

```
%appdata%obsidianobsidian.json for Windows. For MacOS, replace %appdata% with
~LibraryApplication Support. For Linux, replace %appdata% with ~.config.
```
```
file can be either a file name, or a path from the vault root to the specified file.
```
```
To re s o l ve t h e t a rg e t f i l e , O b s i d i a n u s e s t h e s a m e l i n k re s o l u t i o n sys t e m a s a re g u l a r
[[wikilink]] within the vault.
```
```
If the file extension is md , the extension can be omitted.
```
```
path an absolute file system path to a file.
```
```
Using this parameter will override both vault and file.
```
```
This will cause the app to search for the most specific vault which contains the specified file path.
```
```
Then the rest of the path replaces the file parameter.
```
Examples

```
obsidianopenvault=my%20vault
```
This opens the vault my vault. If the vault is already open, focus on the window.

```
obsidianopenvault=ef6ca3e3b524d22f
```
This opens the vault identified by the ID ef6ca3e3b524d22f.

```
obsidianopenvault=my%20vault&file;=my%20note
```
This opens the note my note in the vault my vault , assuming my note exists and the file is my note.md.

```
obsidianopenvault=my%20vault&file;=my%20note.md
```
This also opens the note my note in the vault my vault.

```
obsidianopenvault=my%20vault&file;=path%2Fto%2Fmy%20note
```
This opens the note located at pathtomy note in the vault my vault.

```
obsidianopenpath=%2Fhome%2Fuser%2Fmy%20vault%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%20note
```
This will look for any vault that contains the path homeusermy vaultpathtomy note. Then, the rest of
the path is passed to the file parameter. For example, if a vault exists at homeusermy vault , then this
would be equivalent to file parameter set to pathtomy note.

```
obsidianopenpath=D%3A%5CDocuments%5CMy%20vault%5CMy%20note
```
This will look for any vault that contains the path DDocumentsMy vaultMy note. Then, the rest of the
path is passed to the file parameter. For example, if a vault exists at DDocumentsMy vault , then this
would be equivalent to file parameter set to My note.


##### Action search

Description Opens the search pane for a vault, and optionally perform a search query.

Possible parameters

```
vault can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. Same as action open.
```
```
query (optional) The search query to perform.
```
Examples

```
obsidiansearchvault=my%20vault
```
This opens the vault my vault , and opens the search pane.

```
obsidiansearchvault=my%20vault&query;=MOC
```
This opens the vault my vault , opens the search pane, and performs a search for MOC.

##### Action new

Description Creates a new note in the vault, optionally with some content.

Possible parameters

```
vault can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. Same as action open.
```
```
name the file name to be created. If this is specified, the file location will be chosen based on your
“Default location for new notes” preferences.
```
```
file a vault absolute path, including the name. Will override name if specified.
```
```
path a globally absolute path. Works similar to the path option in the open action, which will override
both vault and file.
```
```
content (optional) the contents of the note.
```
```
silent (optional) set this if you don’t want to open the new note.
```
Examples

```
obsidiannewvault=my%20vault&name;=my%20note
```
This opens the vault my vault , and creates a new note called my note.

```
obsidiannewvault=my%20vault&path;=path%2Fto%2Fmy%20note
```
This opens the vault my vault , and creates a new note at pathtomy note.

##### Action hook-get-address


Description Endpoint for use with Hook. Copies a markdown link of the current focused note to the clipboard, as
an obsidianopen URL. Use obsidianhook-get-address

Possible parameters

```
vault (optional) can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. If not provided, the current or last focused
vault will be used.
```
## Shorthand formats

In addition to the formats above, there are two more “shorthand” formats available to open vaults and files

```
obsidianvaultmy vaultmy note is equivalent to obsidianopen
vault=my%20vault&file;=my%20note
```
```
obsidianabsolutepathtomy note is equivalent to obsidianopen
path=%2Fabsolute%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%20note
```
##### Deleting files

Obsidian has several options for dealing with deleted files, depending on your needs.

```
By default, deleted files are sent to your system trash. Here you can use whatever means your system has
for recovering files you’ve accidentally deleted.
```
```
Deleted files can be sent to a special .trash directory in your Vault. This can be useful if you want the
ability to recover your Vault files separate from your system trash.
```
```
You can also set obsidian to just delete files without possibility of recover y.
```
These options can be found in Settings → Files & Links.

##### Customizing CSS

If you are building or modifying your own css, you can open the developer tools by using Ctrl+Shift+I on
WindowsLinux or Cmd+Opt+I on macOS to get information on the elements you want to customize.

Changes to themes and snippets will be detected automatically and reapplied. You do not need to restart the
app.

### New to CSS

If you’re new to CSS, our community has put together a quick guide to get comfortable with CSS

```
Getting Comfortable with CSS
```
Klaas also put together a helpful index of common CSS snippets that you can feel free to mix and match

```
Obsidian CSS Snippets (on GitHub)
```

##### YAML front matter

## aliases front matter

YAML, also known as front matter, is designed to be file-level metadata that is readable by humans _and_ Obsidian.

Front matter is a section of plain text attributes that starts at the first line of the file. It is one of the most popular
ways to add metadata in a Markdown file, and has been popularized by static generators such as Jekyll, Hugo,
and Gatsby.

A YAML block needs triple dashes at the start and end to be read by Obsidian (and other apps). ==It also needs
to be placed at the very top of the file.==

For example

```
key value
key2 value
key3 [one, two, three]
key4
```
- four
- five
- six
---

As of 0.12.12, there are four keys natively supported

- tags ([[Working with tagsmore information]])
- aliases ([[Add aliases to notemore information]])
- cssclass
- publish ([[Publish#YAML support for Publishmore information]])

As Obsidian continues to develop, we will gradually make it more accessible by plugin developers, and make it
more user friendly.

##### How Obsidian stores data

We believe [[Obsidian#How we’re differentyour data is always yours to own and control]]. Your notes are stored
in markdown, which is an open format based on plain text files, and so should be readable in the future by any
computer that can deal with text files. You can freely edit notes in other software, even while having them open
in Obsidian.

### Per vault data

There is, however, some data that is needed by the software that is not stored in markdown. Obsidian creates a
directory called .obsidian in the root of any vault you create. This contains your configuration, including
custom hotkeys and which plugins are enabled. Any directory starting with a. is invisible on most systems, so
you will probably never see it unless you try. If you delete this directory, none of your data will be gone, but you


will lose your custom settings. It will be recreated when you open that vault in Obsidian again. If you are using
git , it’s probably best to ignore the .obsidianworkspace file, because the this file stores your panes
and opened files, but we haven’t observed any other issues with including it.

### System directory

Obsidian also stores some information in the system directory. This is different per Operating System; on Mac it’s
UsersyourusernameLibraryApplication Supportobsidian , on Windows %APPDATA%Obsidian ,
and $XDG_CONFIG_HOMEObsidian or ~.configObsidian on Linux. As a result, we recommend against
creating a vault in this directory.

Aside from that, though, you can create a Vault anywhere your operating system will allow. Obsidian files sync
fine with Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, git, and every other syncing service we’ve tried thus far.

### Symbolic Links

Starting in v0.11.1, Obsidian will recognize symbolic links and junctions. We do not officially recommend using
these, but we recognize there are valid use-cases for them. Use them at your own risk.

Beware that there are many pitfalls to using symbolic links, and some of them could have serious consequences
such as data-loss, file corruption, or could crash Obsidian.

Below are some limitations or issues we are aware of that you may want to keep in mind

```
Symlink loops are disallowed, to prevent crashing Obsidian due to an infinite loop.
```
```
Symlink targets must be fully disjoint from the vault root or any other symlink targets. Disjoint means one
folder does not contain another, or vice versa. Obsidian will ignore any symlink to a parent folder of the
vault, or from one folder in the vault to another folder in the same vault. It is a safeguard to ensure you
don’t end up with duplicated files in your vault, which could cause links to become ambiguous.
```
```
Symlinks may not play well with Obsidian sync, or any other kind of sync. If the target of a symlink is itself
a directory that’s synced by a different Obsidian vault, you could (potentially) end up with sync conflicts or
data loss. Some sync tools (e.g. git) do not follow symlinks, but rather synchronize the path the symlink
points to, which may produce undesirable results if you share your vault with other people that way.
```
```
Obsidian’s file manager cannot move files across device boundaries, so if you symlink to a folder on a
different drive from your vault, you will not be able to drag files between that folder and other folders using
Obsidian’s file explorer. (You’ll need to use your OS’s explorer for such moves, and Obsidian will see the
move as a deletion and the creation of a new file. It will also not update any links that depended on the
path of that file.)
```
```
File symlinks (as opposed to folder symlinks) may work, but are not officially supported at this time.
Changes performed outside of Obsidian are not watched for, so if you change the file directly, Obsidian will
not detect the change, update search indexes, etc.
```
```
Symlinking things under the .obsidian directory in order to share them between vaults has a high
chance of corrupting your settings, unless you really really know what you’re doing. If you decide to go
this way, at least have backups.
```

### Concepts

##### Current version

Your cur rent version is your Obsidian version. This is the version number that you’ll see in the [Title bar] and the
[Vault switcher].

You can have most of the new features and bug fixes by having an up-to-update cur rent version. However, for
some low-level updates, you might need to bring the [Installer version] up to date.

##### Interface language

The interface of Obsidian has been translated to various languages by [[Credits#Translatorsour amazing
volunteer translators]]. You can change the interface language either in Settings → About or in the [Vault
switcher].

Don’t see your language in the list or seeing untranslated bits Consider [[Contributing to Obsidian#Translating
the docshelp us translate Obsidian into your language]].

##### Installer version

If you look closely in Settings - About, you can find your current version and your installer version.

Installer version will not increase when you [[Update Obsidianauto-update]], unlike the [Current version]. Your
installer version will only increase when you install Obsidian with a new installer.

To g r a b t h e l a t e s t i n s t a l l e r, p l e a s e g o t o o u r [official website].

Most features can be delivered by auto-updating, but to update the engine for certain new features Obsidian, we
encourage you to grab the latest installer from our official website from time to time, when your current version
is above the installer version by a lot, for example when your current version is 0.10.8 while installer version is
0.8.3.

### Customization

##### Custom hotkeys

Most hotkeys are customizable in Obsidian.

We only defined default hotkeys for the most commonly used commands, but if you frequently use a command,
it would save you lots of time if you add a hotkey for it.

For a list of default hotkeys, [[Use hotkeyssee here]].

### Viewing hotkeys


The fastest way to see the hotkey set for a command is to find the command in [Command palette]. If there’s a
hotkey listed for that command, it’s set.

### Setting hotkeys

To a d d a h o t ke y, re m ove a h o t ke y, o r re s t o re h o t ke ys t o d e fa u l t , g o t o S e t t i n g s =  H o t ke ys. N o t e t h a t yo u c a n
also filter the list, as the list of commands is quite long.

##### Appearance

### Base theme

Obsidian comes with two base themes, light and dark. This option sets the default color scheme your theme will
use to either display its light or dark mode version.

### Custom theme

There are lots of community themes contributed by our amazing community that you can easily choose from.

You can easily tweak it by adding [[Add custom styles#Use Themes and or CSS snippetsCSS snippets]].

### Translucency

You can make the window translucent by enabling this option in the settings appearance tab. Cur rently this
option is only available for Windows and macOS.

There is a known issue under Windows where dragging the window is extremely slow when translucency is
enabled. This is due to a Windows bug. A Github issue tracking the status of a fix can be found here
httpsgithub.comriverarsample-win32-acrylicblurissues

### How to

##### Working with backlinks

Backlinks are one of the most powerful features of Obsidian. As a result, they can sometimes be a bit confusing,
so here’s some things that might help.

The Backlinks panel has two sections, Linked mentions and Unlinked mentions.

![[Backlinks.png]]

As you can see, from this document, there is currently one entry in each section. Under Linked mentions you can
see that I made a link to this document in the [Linked pane] note. But, you can also see under Unlinked mentions
that I wrote the name of this note but did not make it a link.

This can be a very powerful way of seeing connections between your notes that you did not know you were
making when you wrote them. If, for example, you have a note named for a concept that comes up often in your
field, you will be able to see easily when it is mentioned in other notes, and thus understand relationships


between ideas you might not have otherwise.

If a reference appears in the Unlinked mentions, and you want to link it, hovering over the text will bring up a Link
button. Clicking this will automatically surround the highlighted text in the referenced note with brackets, making
it into an explicit link.

You can also create a separate, dedicated backlinks pane for a note under the More Options menu. This will be a
[Linked pane] connected to the note, and can be moved around anywhere, as described in [Pane layout]. There’s
also an option to do this in the [Command palette].

##### Add aliases to note

## aliases alias, aliases

Sometimes, you might want to refer to the same file with multiple names in different contexts. These alternative
names are what we call “aliases”.

For example, you might want to refer to your partner by their full name, first name, or a nickname. Or you might
want to refer to “artificial intelligence” by its abbreviation “AI”. If you know multiple languages, you may want to
refer to the same concept with their name in the same language that the rest of the note is written in.

### Set aliases

Starting in 0.9.16, you’re able to specify the “aliases” property in a note’s [YAML front matter] like so

```
aliases [AI, Artificial Intelligence]
---
```
Please note that this section must be placed at the very top of a note to take effect.

In the future, we’ll consider more user-friendly ways to manage aliases than manually writing them in front
matter.

### Link with aliases

Once you’ve set aliases for a file, you can write [[alias]] to link to the original page. A redirect icon will show
up in the auto-complete list like so

![[Insert alises.png]]

An internal link with display text will get inserted like so [[Add aliases to notealias]].

Note the link to alias is NOT inserted as [[alias]] for interoperability, so that other software can recognize it
as well.

### Find unlinked mentions


After you’ve set aliases for a note, you can find unlinked mentions by both its name and its aliases.

For example, after setting “AI” as an alias for “Artificial intelligence”, you’ll see mentions of “AI” in other files in
the [Backlinks] section.

If you decide to link this mention, a link with display text set to the alias will be created for you. Following the
example above, AI will become [[Artificial intelligenceAI]] once you click on the “Link” button.

##### Change settings

The settings can be found by clicking the gear in the bottom left corner, or by hitting CtrlCmd-,. Most of
them are fairly self-explanatory, but here are some notes that might be helpful.

```
Most of the settings are toggle switches. If there are more details to a setting, it may have a gear next to
the switch for additional settings. For example, the gear next to Spell Check reveals the custom dictionary,
so you can remove words you may have accidentally added.
```
```
Enabling plugins will cause their settings to appear in the list of tabs. For example, if you have the Daily
Note plugin enabled, a setting tab will appear that allows you to further configure it.
```
##### Working with multiple cursors

If you hold down Alt ( option on mac) and click, you can create multiple cursors. This can be useful when
modifying a lot of lines in the same way, for example putting - at the beginning of multiple lines to turn them
into a list, or appending [[ to a series of links you’ve copied from elsewhere.

To c a n c e l m u l t i p l e c u r s o r s , e i t h e r c l i c k s o m e w h e re i n t h e n o t e ( w i t h o u t a m o d i f i e r ke y ) , o r h i t e s c a p e.

##### Folding

Folding text is an extremely powerful tool for outlining or writing, in order to focus on what you’re working on.

To u s e fo l d i n g , g o t o S e t t i n g s ( t h e g e a r i c o n o n t h e l e f t ) =  E d i t o r a n d t u r n o n Fold indent and Fold
heading.

Obsidian has the ability to fold both markdown headers and indented lists. Note that at the top of this note there
is a downward pointing arrow next to the title. If clicked, it will fold the entire note up, and if clicked again, it will
show the note. This can be applied at multiple levels of markdown, as well as multiple levels of indentation in
lists.

## By way of example

```
1. Categories of things
```
```
2. A subcategory
```
```
3. Another subcategory
```
```
i. An example of an item
```

```
ii. A different, equally important item.
```
##### Use hotkeys

Hotkeys help you get work done faster. If you frequently per

If you have the [Command palette] enabled, You can use CtrlCmd+P to bring it up, which will show you all
currently available commands and hotkeys.

Most hotkeys can be [[Custom hotkeyscustomized]] for your needs in Settings → Hotkeys.

##### Embed files

### Embed attachments

You can embed attachment files like images or audio in your notes. Use the ![[filename.png]] syntax like
so

![[Engelbart.jpg]]

![[Excerpt from Mother of All Demos (1968).ogg]]

You can embed a PDF file in your notes with the same syntax. Additionally, you can write ![[My
File.pdf#page=number]] to open to that specific page of the PDF directly.

### Embed notes

You can embed a note also, with the same syntax

![Accepted file formats]

### iframe

“iframe” is a way to embed a web page in another. It’s useful because Markdown can accept HTML, which is a
simple language to construct the web pages we see every day.

For example

```
iframe src=httpswww.youtube.comembedNnTvZWp5Q7oiframe
```
Produces


#### Making a Minecraft Obsidi...

The basic syntax is

```
iframe src=INSERT YOUR URL HEREiframe
```
Some websites have quirks that don’t allow you to embed them. For example, you can’t embed a YouTube video
by using its normal URL, but you can use its embed URL which is
httpswww.youtube.comembedVIDEO_ID.

If you want to embed a website, try searching for “{website} embed iframe”.

For example, you can embed Twitter tweets like so as suggested by search results

```
iframe
border=
frameborder=
height=
width=
src=httpstwitframe.comshowurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjack%2Fstatus%2F20
iframe
```
### Developer notes

The syntax is inspired by Markdown’s image syntax. We had two observations

```
1. [Image](link.png) links to the image, but ![Image](link.png) actually displays it.
```

2. The internal link syntax is based on this assumption [[My page]] is a shortcut (or “syntactic sugar” if
you will) for [My page](My page).
```
To c o m b i n e t h e s e t wo t h i n g s , we c a n c o m e u p w i t h a t h i rd p a t t e r n  ![[My page]] should be equivalent to!
[My page](My page) , which by the image convention, if the title is the same as the link, should display it.

There are other implementations out there, for example Roam Research uses {{embed ((NODE_ID))}}. We
have also considered using the ((Page name)) syntax too, but we feel like ![[Page name]] is more
consistent, more familiar, and leaves more room so that the other symbols to have their own meanings.

##### Resize images

You can resize images using the following syntax

For markdown images, use ![AltText100x100](httpsurltoimage.png)

For embeds, use ![[image.png100x100]]

To h ave t h e i m a g e s c a l e a c c o rd i n g t o i t s a s p e c t r a t i o , o m i t t h e h e i g h t ![[image.png100]]

##### Import data

There are a few differences between the way various PKM and note taking systems work that mean moving
between them can be a little complicated. For the most part, if whatever you’re using can be converted to
markdown, it will work fairly well within Obsidian. But some things, like tags and links, can be tricky.

On our Forum there is a post collecting methods that other people have developed. Right now, it includes

```
Import from Notion
```
```
Import from Notion (automated)
```
```
Import from Evernote
```
```
Import from OneNote
```
```
Import from Apple Notes
```
```
Import from Bear
```
```
Import from Zkn
```
```
Import from TiddlyWiki 5
```
But if you don’t see your system on this list, check out the forum post, someone may have solved your issue
since this document was written.

Also of note, the makers of nvUltra, another markdown-based note-taking program, have a list on their website
of ways to export to nvUltra. In a lot of cases, these will be the same, or at least a helpful place to start.

## Built-in tools


### From Roam Research

If you have data in Roam, it’s easy to export and play around with it in Obsidian.

```
1. Choose “Export all” in the menu
```
```
![[Pasted image.png]]
```
```
1. Click the blue “Export all” button
```
```
![[Pasted image 1.png]]
```
```
1. Unzip the “Roam-Export-xxxxxxxxxxxxx.zip” into a folder.
```
```
2. Click on the vault icon (the tooltip should say “Open another vault”) on the bottom left corner in the
app, and select “Open folder as vault”.
```
```
Pick the folder you just unzipped to.
```
```
1. Use our [markdown format converter] to convert Roam Research’s Markdown format into Obsidian’s
format.
```
```
It can be used turn #tag into Obsidian [[links]].
```
```
It can also convert ^^highlight^^ into ==highlight==.
```
### From Bear

If you’re importing from Bear, the [Markdown format converter] plugin has an option to convert
highlight to ==highlight==.

### Using Zettelkasten

If you’ve been using the Zettelkasten method to structure your notes, here’s something you might want to know

Links in Obsidian require a full match to the note name. This means that [[202001010000]] will not properly
link to [[202001010000 My Note]].

In order to fix that, you can use our [markdown format converter] to convert your Zettelkasten links into either
[[202001010000 My Note]] or [[202001010000 My NoteMy Note]].

You might also be interested in the [Zettelkasten prefixer] plugin.

##### Preview and edit modes

In obsidian, a document can be viewed in either edit mode or preview mode. In edit mode, you will see basic
markdown rendering, but certain things, like code syntax highlighting and embedded files, will only show up in
preview mode. Most notably, any images you embed will only be visible in preview mode.


To t o g g l e b e t we e n p re v i e w a n d e d i t m o d e , c l i c k t h e p re v i e w b u t t o n i n t h e t i t l e b a r. I n e d i t m o d e , i t w i l l a p p e a r a s
a page; in preview mode, a pencil. If you CmdCtrl - click, the preview will be opened in a [Linked pane]. You
can also toggle Preview Mode by hitting CmdCtrl-E , but this hotkey can, of course, be changed.

If you want to default to opening in preview rather than edit mode, a toggle for that can be found in the
[Command palette]. You can also set a [[Use hotkeysKeyboard Shortcut]] for toggling between default states.

##### Working with tags

Ta g s a r e a ve r y u s e f u l w ay o f g r o u p i n g m u l t i p l e n o t e s s o t h e y a r e e a s y t o f i n d. A t a g i s e s s e n t i a l l y a c l i c k a b l e
search through your entire Vault for a term. For example, clicking on #tags will bring up a search with all notes
that contain that tag. Most people use them for broad categories of things, like a class you might be taking notes
in or a type of idea. Some Zettelkasten practitioners like to use them as “entry points” for thinking about
connected ideas. But ultimately, they are flexible enough that you can use them in any way you would like.

### Ta g p a n e

If you have the [Ta g p a n e] plugin enabled, you will see a list of all tags that are used across all of your notes,
sorted by frequency. Clicking on any of those will activate that search.

This will allow you to search exact matches of a tag. For example, when clicking , as per usual, but if you want to
find all instances of maintag with all subtags, you can still use the [Search] to look for #maintag. This is
useful in cases where you have subcategories of things but you also want to be able to easily find all instances of
the higher category.

### Allowed characters

Spaces are not allowed in tags. So, if you want to have multiple words in a tag, you can use these formats

```
CamelCase #TwoWords
```
```
Underscore #two_words
```
```
Dash #two-words
```
The only symbols allowed are

```
1. _ (underscore) and - (dash) to separate words;
```
```
2.  (forward slash) for [[Tag pane#Nested tagsnested tags]].
```
Numbers are allowed in the tag, ==as long as the tag is not purely numeric==. For example, #1984 does not form
a valid tag, but #y1984 is valid.

##### Working with multiple vaults

Each collection of notes in Obsidian is known as a Vault. A Vault consists of a folder, and any sub-folders within
it. Right now, you’re looking at the Obsidian Help Vault, which is just a folder of files included with Obsidian.


You can open another Vault anywhere on your computer, and it will retain its own individual [[Core
pluginsPlugins]] and [[Add custom stylescustom styling]]. This is useful, for example, if you have one Vault
where you keep notes but a different one in which you do long-form writing.

A new or existing Vault can be opened from the button just above the Settings gear.

![[Vault picker.png]]

You have the option to either open an existing folder of markdown files, create a new vault (which essentially just
creates a new folder that you will put markdown files into), or opening a special vault containing these help files.
The Help Vault is stored in a special Obsidian directory (see [How Obsidian stores data]), but aside from that, it’s
a directory of files just like any other.

[[Internal linkInternal Links]] are not shared across Vaults. If you have one Vault inside another Vault, this can get
confusing, so we recommend not doing that.

Always remember, a Vault is just a collection of markdown files. You can use whatever file management
techniques you would normally to move them around on your file system, and Obsidian will automatically refresh
to keep up.

### Transfer settings between vaults

All settings, themes, and plugins are stored in the .obsidian folder under your vault. If you copy this folder
from one vault to another, all the settings will be transferred as well. You may need to restart Obsidian for all of
the settings to take effect.

This folder is hidden in some operating systems. Notably, you can use Cmd-Shift-Period to show hidden files
on macOS in order to reveal the .obsidian folder.

##### Link to blocks

In Obsidian 0.9.5 or higher, in addition to [[Internal link#Link to headingslinking to headings]], you can also link
to blocks.

### What is a block

A “block” can be a paragraph, a blockquote, a list item, etc. In general, anything that has empty lines before and
after is a block. ^dcf64c

### Link to blocks

To l i n k t o a b l o c k i n a s p e c i f i c f i l e , f i r s t t y p e [[filename to bring up a list of matched files. After selecting a
file, type ^ and continue typing to search for blocks to link to.

Once you hit enter, a link to that block will be generated for you, in the format similar to
[[filename#^dcf64c]] , where dcf64c is the block ID that was just generated for you.

If you’re not sure which file the block is in, another method is to type [[^^ and search for blocks in all files.
This will search through all the blocks in your vault, so expect a bit of delay if your vault is large.


For example, [[#^dcf64c]] is a link to a block above.

### Embed or transclude blocks

Similar to [[Embed filesfiles embeds]], you can simply use! in front of a block link to embed it.

Here’s an example

![[#^dcf64c]]

### Manual block IDs

If you want human readable block IDs, you can manually put ^your-id after a block. Make sure there’s at least
one space if you’re putting the ID at end of a line.

To re fe r t o c o m p l ex b l o c ks l i ke t a b l e s , p u t t h e b l o c k I D o n i t s ow n a f t e r t h e b l o c k , a n d m a ke s u re t h e re i s a n
empty line both before and after the block ID.

After you add the block ID manually, when you refer to that block, your-id will be used instead of a randomly
generated block ID.

Note that only letters, numbers, and dashes are allowed in manual block IDs.

### Interoperability

Please be aware that block reference is not part of standard Markdown, but rather Obsidian’s specific flavor of
Markdown. That means these links will not work outside of Obsidian.

You can still find referenced block by searching for the block ID, although that ’s a rather manual process. The
connection is not lost as long as you have software that can search in a folder.

##### Capture information

### Copy and paste

When you see something useful online, you can simply select the text, copy, and paste in Obsidian. Obsidian will
try to convert it into proper Markdown so that it fits right in.

If you only wish to copy the text without the formatting, please use Ctrl-Shift-V on Windows and Linux and
Cmd-Shift-V on macOS to do so.

### Use a clipper extension

Because Obsidian accepts any Markdown file, you can clip entire web pages by clipping to Markdown files and
downloading them into your vault.

death_au’s “MarkDownload” browser extension works well for this purpose. You can get it for

```
Google Chrome
```

```
Firefox
```
```
Microsoft Edge
```
##### Manage attachments

## Add an attachment

There are several ways to include attachments in your notes

```
1. Copy and paste;
```
```
2. Drag and drop;
```
```
3. Download or copy file to vault folder.
```
After being added, these attachment files are just normal files and can still be accessed through your file system.

Please note that only [Accepted file formats] are handled.

### Copy and paste

Pasting a local file from your system explorer or your clipboard will put the file into your vault.

This is very handy when combined with screenshot tools.

### Drag and drop

If you drag and drop a file from your file explorer, it will be copied to your vault as well.

### Download or copy to vault folder

This can work well when paired with [[Capture information#Use a clipper extensionclipper extensions]].

You can also download images from your browser into your vault folder direc tly for later reference.

## Change default attachment location

By default, new attachments will be dropped in the root of your vault. You can fine tune this setting in Settings
= Files & Links = “Default location for new attachments”.

### Choose a folder

You can choose a fixed folder to always place your attachments in. To do this, choose “In the folder specified
below”, and choose a folder in your vault in the new field that appears.

Alternatively, you can right click on a folder in [File explorer] and choose “Set as attachment folder”.


### Same folder as current file

Sometimes, you may want the attachment files to always be in the same folder as the note you’re working on. In
this case, choose “Same folder as current file”.

### Under the current folder

You can also choose to save attachments to a folder under neath the folder that the cur rent file is in.

To d o t h i s , c h o o s e t h e “ S u b fo l d e r u n d e r c u r re n t fo l d e r ” o p t i o n , a n d w r i t e t h e n a m e o f t h e s u b fo l d e r i n t h e f i e l d
that appears. For example, if you write assets , and your note is in VAULTfolderpath , the attachments
will be added to VAULTfolderpathassets when you’re working on this note.

You don’t need to create the subfolder beforehand; if it doesn’t exist, Obsidian will create it for you.

##### Add custom styles

When you want to add custom styles to your vault, there are two main ways to do this

## Va u l t s t y l e s

### Themes

Themes allow you to toggle the appearance of your vault with a dropdown menu once they have been added to
your vault’s theme directory.

This configuration can be found in Settings = Appearance = Themes section of your vault settings.

### Create a custom theme

If you are creating your own theme, you can do this by

```
1. Creating your custom theme CSS file in the themes directory
YOUR_VAULT.obsidianthemesYOUR_CUSTOM_THEME.css
```
```
2. Enabling it in the theme dropdown under Settings = Appearance = Themes
```
For more information on how to customize styles of the graph, you can find more information in [Graph view].

### Use Themes andor CSS snippets

You can find this configuration in Settings = Appearance. You can choose a community theme or set the
theme you developed yourself. If you set a community theme, it will be automatically placed in the correct folder.
If you develop your own theme, you have to put it in the shown folder location yourself.

CSS snippets are supposed to be small pieces of CSS for small changes you want to makethings you want to
add. These snippets have to be placed in the shown directory.


You can go to the respec tive direc tories by clicking on the folder buttons. If the folder isn’t created yet, it will be.
In case your snippets or theme don’t show up after you’ve put them there, you can click the button next to the
folder icon to refresh the list.

## Obsidian Publish styles

At this time, [Obsidian Publish] is unable to automatically detect the vault’s configured [[Add custom
styles#Themestheme]] and publish the respective styles.

A workaround for this limitation is to

```
1. Go into YOUR_VAULT.obsidianthemesCURRENT_THEME_FOLDER ;
```
```
2. Copy the primary CSS file CURRENT_THEME.css in the folder;
```
```
3. Paste it in the root directory of your vault ( YOUR_VAULT );
```
```
4. Rename the CSS file as publish.css ;
```
```
5. In the publish plugin, upload the publish.css file;
```
```
6. If your CSS doesn’t take effect in a few minutes, try refreshing the browser cache as the stale CSS might
have been cached.
```
##### Basic note taking

If you’ve just opened Obsidian, you’ll see two documents here. The one in the left pane is a text file, which you
can edit using Markdown syntax. The one in the right pane is a _Preview_ of the same text file if you were to export
it as HTML, or as a PDF document. Note that some things look different in Preview, and, most obviously, links are
not in brackets. To follow a link, click on it in the Preview pane. You can follow links in the Editor pane as well, by
holding down CtrlCmd and clicking on the link. If you want to go back to the page you were on before, use the
shortcut CtrlCmd-alt-LeftArrow

Alternatively, the notes that link to the one you’re currently on will be shown in the Backlinks Panel on the right
(find more about Backlinks [[Backlinkshere.]])

If you get lost at any time, or just want to explore what else Obsidian can do, CtrlCmd-P brings up the
Command Palette. You can type commands there, like “Navigate back”, and you’ll see options filter to a short list,
along with hotkey shortcuts if they have them.

At base, Obsidian is a tool for working with a bunch of markdown files that are stored on your computer. If you’re
not familiar with markdown, it’s just plain text with some formatting that makes it powerful (for more on that, see
[[Format your notesMarkdown]]). As a result, if you want to use obsidian for keeping regular notes on just about
anything, it will work great.

Let’s say you want to write a note about your favorite band. Just type the name of the note surrounded by two
square brackets, like [[My Favorite Band]]

Try it here (make sure you’re typing in the Editor pane)


You’ll notice that the text and the brackets tur n blue. That means it ’s a link now. Click on that link in the Preview
(or Cmd-click in the Editor), and you’ll see a blank note. Write whatever you want there, and when you’re
done, come back here with Cmd-alt-left , or by clicking the name of this note ([Basic note taking]) in the
Backlinks to the right. To learn more about navigating links, see [Internal link].

Notice that your new note showed up automatically in the File Explorer to the left. Obsidian automatically creates
files when you click a link to a file that does not exist. This means you can [[write naturally]] about
[[whatever comes to mind]] and then go back and create the new notes at your leisure. This makes
Obsidian a fantastic tool for thinking freely in notes without having to worry about where to file them. And if you
decide that a title is not what you actually meant, you can change the file name at the top of this window, and
Obsidian will automatically update all links to it.

From there, you can make any kind of structure you want. Many people will want to make a Table of
Contents note for listing major groups of notes. You can also use #tags to create categories (if you click that it
will show you every note that contains #tags ). Really, the structure you build should be whatever works for you.
We suggest you just start with what feels natural. Obsidian is flexible enough that it should be relatively simple to
rearrange things later.

Be aware! The note you just created is in these Help documents, which will be overwritten on new releases. ==If
you created anything you care to keep, it should be put into a different vault==. For details on how to do that, see
[Working with multiple vaults].

If you want an example of a more advanced technique, you might look into the sample workflows on our forum.

##### Update Obsidian

### How auto-update works

Obsidian checks for update every 12 hours. Once an update is available, restarting the app will automatically
bring you to the latest version.

You can check your cur rent version, check for updates in Settings = About. You can also tur n off “automatic
updates” there.

### Insider build

If you’re looking to update to the latest insider build, please refer to [[Insider builds#How to enable insider
buildthis guide]] on how to turn it on.

### Current version vs installed version

If you look closely in Settings = About, you can find your current version and your installer version.

Your cur rent version is your Obsidian version. This is the version of the app on top of the engine (which is
Electron). It will increase when you auto-update, but your installer version will not. Your installer version will only
increase when you install Obsidian with a new installer.


Most features can be delivered by auto-updating, but to update the engine for certain new features Obsidian, we
encourage you to grab the latest installer from our official website from time to time, when your current version
is above the installer version by a lot, for example when your current version is 0.10.8 while installer version is
0.8.3.

##### Format your notes

Obsidian is a Markdown-based note-taking and knowledge base app.

We currently support the formats below

### Internal linking

```
Link to a page [[Internal link]].
```

### Links

##### External links

Markdown style links can be used to refer to either external objects, such as web pages, or an internal page or
image.

```
httpobsidian.md - automatic!
[Obsidian](httpobsidian.md)
```
[httpobsidian.md](httpobsidian.md) - automatic!
Obsidian

##### Obsidian URI links

[[Using obsidian URIObsidian URI]] links can be used to open notes in Obsidian either from another Obsidian
vault or another program.

For example, you can link to a file in a vault like so (please note the [[Using obsidian URI#Encodingrequired
encoding]])

```
[Link to note](obsidianopenpath=D%2Fpath%2Fto%2Ffile.md)
```
Link to note

You can link to a note by its vault name and file name instead of path as well

```
[Link to note](obsidianopenvault=MainVault&file;=MyNote.md)
```

Link to note

##### Escaping

If there are spaces in the url, they can be escaped by either using %20 as a space, such as

```
[Export options](Pasted%20image)
```
Export options

Or you can enclose the target in  , such as

```
[Slides Demo](Slides Demo)
```
Slides Demo()

### Blockquotes

```
Human beings face ever more complex and urgent problems, and their effectiveness in dealing with these
problems is a matter that is critical to the stability and continued progress of society.
```
- Doug Engelbart, 1961

### Inline code

```
Text inside `backticks` on a line will be formatted like code.
```
Tex t i n s i d e backticks on a line will be formatted like code.

### Code blocks

Syntax highlight is supported with the language specified after the first set of backticks. We use prismjs for
syntax highlighting, a list of supported languages can be found at their site

```
js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
if(arg) {
$.facebox({div'#foo'})
}
}
```
```

### Ta b l e s

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and
then separating each column with a pipe  

```
First Header  Second Header
------------  ------------
Content from cell 1  Content from cell 2
Content in the first column  Content in the second column
```
```
First Header Second Header
```
```
Content from cell 1 Content from cell 2
```
```
Content in the first column Content in the second column
```
```
Text indented with a tab is formatted like this, and will also look like a code block in preview.
```
```
Tables can be justified with a colon  Another example with a long title
-----------------------------
because of the ``  these will be justified
```

_Ta b l e s c a n b e j u s t i f i e d w i t h a c o l o n  A n o t h e r ex a m p l e w i t h a l o n g t i t l e_
⸻⸺-⸻—-
because of the   these will be justified

If you put links in tables, they will work, but if you use Piped Links, the pipe must be escaped with a  to
prevent it being read as a table element.

```

### Math

```
$$begin{vmatrix}a & b
c & d
end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$
```
[begin{vmatrix}a & b c & d end{vmatrix}=ad-bc]

You can also do inline math like (e^{2ipi} = 1).

Obsidian uses Mathjax. You can check which packages are supported in Mathjax here.

### Comments

Use %% to enclose comments, which will be parsed as Markdown, but will not show up in the preview.

```
Here is some inline comments %%You can't see this text%% (Can't see it)
Here is a block comment
%%
It can span
multiple lines
%%
```
Here is some inline comments %%You can’t see this text%% (can’t see it in preview)

### Diagram

Obsidian uses Mermaid to render diagrams and charts. Mermaid also provides a helpful live editor.

```
mermaid
sequenceDiagram
Alice-+John Hello John, how are you
Alice-+John John, can you hear me
John---Alice Hi Alice, I can hear you!
John---Alice I feel great!
```
```
sequenceDiagram
Alice-+John Hello John, how are you
Alice-+John John, can you hear me
John---Alice Hi Alice, I can hear you!
John---Alice I feel great!
```

Obsidian supports linking to notes in Mermaid

```
```mermaid
graph TD
```
```
Biology – Chemistry
```
```
class Biology,Chemistry internal-link;
```
```
An easier way to do it is the following ^376b9d

```
```mermaid
graph TD
```
```
A[Biology]
B[Chemistry]
```
```
A – B
```
```
class A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z internal-link;
```
```
This way, all the note names (at least until Z[note name] ) are all automatically assigned the class internal-
link when you use this snippet.

If you use special characters in your note names, you need to put the note name in double quotes.
⨳ special character
It looks like this if you follow the [[Format your notes#^376b9dsecond option]]

## Developer notes


We strive for maximum capability without breaking any existing formats, therefore we use a slightly unorthodox
combination of flavors of markdown. It is broadly CommonMark, with the addition of some functionality from
GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), some latex support, and our chosen embed syntax, which you can read more
about at [Accepted file formats].

##### Internal link

Internal links are the backbone of your knowledge network.

### Link to files

To c re a t e a n i n t e r n a l l i n k , s i m p l y t y p e [[. This will prompt you with the list of notes you can link to. Use Up
arrow and Down arrow to navigate the suggestion list and Enter to select the current highlighted link.

### Link to headings

You can also link to specific headers in files. Star t typing a link like you would nor mally. When the note you want
is highlighted, press # instead of Enter and you’ll see a list of headings in that file. Continue typing or
navigate with arrow keys as before, press # again at each subheading you want to add, and Enter to
complete the link.

To m a ke t h e l i n k d i s p l ay d i f fe re n t t ex t t h a n i t s re a l n o t e n a m e i n P re v i e w, u s e t h e ve r t i c a l p i p e ( Shift+ ) For

##### Working with multiple notes

You can edit and view multiple files in Obsidian.

To e f fe c t i ve l y u s e s p l i t v i e w, yo u o n l y n e e d t o k n ow a fe w t h i n g s 

1. ==Use CtrlCmd key== when you want to open things in a new pane.

By default, when you click something, it will open in the active pane. The active pane is marked with highlighted
bar under the title, and its title is more visible than the inactive panes.


To o p e n f i l e s i n n e w p a n e s , h o l d d ow n CtrlCmd while you click in Preview mode ( Shift + CtrlCmd in Edit
mode). This applies to a number of places, including [file explorer], [backlinks] (both links and unlinked
mentions), [search] results, and [graph view]. It also applies to buttons; instead of previewing in the current
pane, you can Cmd+click the preview button to preview in a new pane. When using the Quick Switcher,
holding down CmdCtrl when hitting Enter will open in a new pane.

2. You can also create new panes by ==splitting==.

To c re a t e o t h e r l ayo u t s , yo u c a n s p l i t t h e c u r re n t p a n e i n h a l f e i t h e r h o r i zo n t a l l y o r ve r t i c a l l y. D o t h i s w i t h t h e
menu at the top right of the pane, use the command palette, or set a [Use hotkeys].

![[Pasted image 16.png]]

3. If you want a sticky pane that does not get replaced even when it’s active, ==pin it==.

This is great if you’re working on something and want to use the other panes as temporary reference panes. Pin
it to make sure it never gets replaced.

![[Pasted image 17.png]]

Pinned panes will have a highlighted pin icon instead of a grey one.

4. Use ==linked panes== for previewing.

When creating [[Linked panelinked panes]], CtrlCmd+click the preview or edit button when a Markdown file
is open.

When linked to another pane, the panes’ scroll position will be synced, and if you open a file in one pane, the
other pane will open the same file.

[[Linked paneLinked panes]] will be marked with a link icon. You can hover the link to see which pane it’s linked
to, or click the icon to release it, so that they are no longer linked.

For more information see [[Linked panelinked panes]].

![[Pasted image 18.png]]

5. Panes can be ==rearranged by dragging==.

Grab the icon in the upper left corner to arrange them however you need. For detailed information, see [Pane
layout].

Useful tips

```
1. You can resize the panes however you want, by dragging the resize handle that ’s between each pane.
```
```
2. Your file layout, including their sizes, will be remembered when you close the app, so don’t wor r y about
having to set them up every time you open the app!
```

##### Rename notes

If you’re already editing the note, you can rename it simply by editing the text in the title

![[Pasted image 6.png]]

If you want to rename a note that you’re not editing, go to [file explorer], right-click on the note or folder and
choose “Rename”

![[Pasted image 7.png]]

An even faster way is to press F2 while your mouse is over a note, which will take you straight to the renaming
function.

##### Create notes

Notes are created in a few ways, depending on your workflow

```
1. Note-first approach. If you need to create a note, you can do so in [File explorer]. The keyboard shortcut
is CtrlCmd+N. Also, if you have the [Command palette] plugin enabled (it’s on by default), press
CtrlCmd-p and type ‘new’, then select 
```
```
2. Link-first approach. If you like to freely create notes, just use an [Internal link] to link to any note name (it
doesn’t need to exist at the time of creating the link). To write in the newly created note, simply click on
the link name. It will be automatically created in your Vault and ready to type!
```
![[Pasted image 3.png]]

After creating it, the note title will appear in the internal link auto-completion, so you don’t need to type out the
note name every time. When you type [[ a popup will come up showing all the notes in your vault. Just type
until you see the one you want, and hit Return or click on it, and the name will be automatically filled in.

If you already have folders set up in [File explorer], you can right-click on a folder to create notes inside it

![[Pasted image 4.png]]

There are also buttons at the top of the file explorer for creating new notes or folders.

Obsidian automatically saves your note two seconds after you stop typing, or if you close a pane. You can also
manually save at any time by typing CtrlCmd-S

##### Obsidian Unlimited

Obsidian Unlimited is a way to contribute a custom amount to Obsidian develop as you wish. You can also
contribute multiple times at any time.

You can find this option at the bottom of the page in your Obsidian account page after logging in.

Special thanks to the VIPs who proposed this “feature” to support Obsidian even more.

==Contributing to Obsidian Unlimited does not let you give any additional features or benefits.== For this reason,
we recommend upgrading to [Catalyst license] first, if you’re looking to access [Insider builds] or get cool
badges in our community.

Note we’ve set the minimal amount to $5 (so that processing fees would make sense).

##### Obsidian Sync

Obsidian Sync™ is a paid service to sync notes between vaults on various devices.

### How Obsidian Sync works

Obsidian Sync is fairly simple once you hook up local vaults from multiple devices to the same remote vault,
changes will be automatically synced between these local vaults, except for files and folders you instruct
Obsidian to ignore.

### Features

Currently, Obsidian Sync features

```
End-to-end encryption.
```
```
Version history integrated into Obsidian.
```
```
View & restore deleted files.
```
```
Synchronize settings, themes, CSS snippets, plugins, and plugin settings.
```

```
Selective sync.
```
```
Exclude certain folders.
```
```
To g g l e sy n c i n g fo r i m a g e s , a u d i o , v i d e o , P D F, a n d u n s u p p o r t e d f i l e s.
```
```
Switch between multiple remote vaults.
```
In the future, we’ll improve Obsidian Sync with

```
Vault sharing
```
### Enable Obsidian Sync plugin

You can enable Obsidian Sync by enabling the “Sync” plugin under Settings = Core plugins.

### Setting up remote vaults

Warning We do not recommend using third party sync services to sync the same vault with Obsidian Sync.
[[#Third party syncMore about this later]].

To s t a r t sy n c i n g , f i r s t yo u n e e d t o c re a t e a re m o t e va u l t t h a t s t o re s yo u r e n c r y p t e d d a t a.

To d o t h a t , g o t o S e t t i n g =  S y n c =  P i c k re m o t e va u l t =  C h o o s e =  C re a t e n e w va u l t.

After creating it, you can immediately connect to the vault by clicking on the “Connect” button next to it.

You can choose to either star t syncing immediately after connec ting, or choose folders to ignore.

Set encryption password

By default, you need to set an encryption password for your vault. This password is used to encrypt and decrypt
your data and is extremely important.

You’ll be asked for the password any time you setup sync with an encr ypted vault. ==If you forget or lose the
password, your data will remain encrypted and unusable forever. We are unable to recover your password or any
encrypted data for you.== Your local files are not affected.

You can also choose to tur n off the “Custom end-to-end password” option to leave managing the encr yption key
to us. This is still fairly secure and provides the convenience of not having to remember a password.

### Check sync status

After connecting to a remote vault, you can check the current sync status in the bottom status bar. You can
hover over the status icon to read more about what’s going on.

Clicking on the status icon will open up sync settings as a shortcut.

### Version history


As you edit your notes, versions are saved approximately every 10 seconds. ==Version history is only available
for notes, not attachments.==

You can right click a file in the file explorer pane to see its version histor y. This option is also available in the more
options menu.

After selecting a version in the left column in the version history screen, you can restore the file to this version by
clicking on the “Restore” button.

### Deleted files

After you delete a file, you can view it in Setting = Sync = Deleted files = View.

Clicking on a deleted file will open its version history. You can then choose to restore the file back to a previous
version.

### Selective sync

You can selec tively sync files by folder or file type. ==Selec tive sync only applies to future changes. Any files
that have already been uploaded will not be deleted even if you choose to ignore them. Please be sure to
configure it before starting the sync process.==

Exclude folders

You can uncheck folders in Settings = Sync = Excluded folders = Manage to prevent them from getting
synced.

Excluded folders will be ignored when both uploading and download changes.

##### File types

You can toggle sync for images, audio, video, PDFs, and unsuppor ted files under Settings = Sync = Selec tive
sync.

### Synchronizing settings

In addition to your notes and attachments, Obsidian Sync offers individual toggles to synchronize these files

```
The main app settings, including editor settings, files & links settings, etc.
```
```
Appearance settings, including dark mode, selected theme, and enabled snippets.
```
```
Themes and snippets that has been downloaded.
```
```
Hotkeys.
```
```
Which [Core plugins] are enabled.
```
```
Core plugin settings.
```
```
Which community plugins are enabled.
```

```
Downloadedinstalled community plugins, and their settings.
```
You can choose which ones to synchronize with your remote vault to best suite your use case of Obsidian.

Keep in mind that Obsidian does not apply your settings until you restart the application, or reload the vault. This
normally isn’t a problem on mobile since the app restarts often, but you may notice that settings you set on one
desktop device is “synced” to another device, but doesn’t take effect until the next restart.

Sync will respect your selection of the settings folder override in case you’ve set it to a folder other than
.obsidian. You can take advantage of this to create different profiles in your remote vault to sync your
settings. A common use case, for example, is to use a different profile for mobile devices vs desktop devices.

##### Settings version history

If something goes wrong, and you lost some of your settings, you can always revert the affected settings file
through the “Settings version history” section in Sync.

### Third party sync

If you are using Obsidian Sync, we do not recommend using third party sync services like Dropbox, Google Drive,
OneDrive, or iCloud to sync the same vault between the same devices using Obsidian Sync. Doing so may cause
conflicts, duplicate files, or in the worst case, could lead to corrupted files.

If you do setup Obsidian Sync and a third party sync service to sync a vault between two devices, then the
following will happen

```
If Obsidian Sync “wins” the race and syncs your file first, then your third party sync service will generate a
“conflicted copy”.
```
```
If your third party sync service “wins” the race and syncs your file first, then Obsidian Sync will attempt to
merge the two slightly different versions, often causing the last few characters you just typed to be rolled
back.
```
If you wish to maintain a backup of your vault using a third party sync service, you can still do so by setting up
your sync provider on your primary single device, but not on your secondary devices. This will ensure that your
third party sync service does not “race” with Obsidian Sync.

### FAQ

What is end-to-end encryption

End-to-end encryption means the data is encrypted from the moment it leaves your device, and can only be
decrypted using your encryption key once it’s back on one of your devices.

We do not have the capability of reading your data, nor do any potential eavesdroppers, such as your internet
service provider.

In the rare case of a complete server breach, your data will remain encrypted, and nobody will have the ability to
decrypt your files without knowing your password.


How many remote vaults can I have

Each account with Obsidian Sync can have up to 5 remote vaults.

How long is version history kept

Version histories are kept for up to one year before we clean it up.

How large can each remote vault be

At the moment, each remote vault can have up to 4 GB of data, including version history.

Is my data encrypted on my hard disk

No, your data is still in plain text on your hard disk. If you wish to encrypt it from people who use your computer,
you should look for a disk encryption solution.

How long is my data kept after my subscription expires

Data in your remote vaults, including version history, is kept for one month for you, after your subscription
expires.

As long as you renew within one month, there should be no impact on your usage.

Can I use Obsidian Sync as a backup solution

Obsidian Sync is designed as a data synchronization service, rather than a backup service.

With version history, it does provide some backup features, however we still recommend having additional
backup measures.

Obsidian Sync is currently in beta testing, so we strongly recommend having backups, in case of software bugs
and glitches.

Should I pick my own encryption password

Pick your password if you require the highest level of security and privacy. This guarantees that anyone who
doesn’t know your password will never be able to read your notes.

Letting us manage your encryption key is more convenient, and you do not risk forgetting or losing your
password.

Your local vault is not affec ted by this option. If you properly backup your local vault, this may not be a problem
for you.

Is the end-to-end encryption strong

We use industry-standard AES–256 to encrypt your data. AES–256 is a military-grade encryption specification
that is widely used in online banking.

Here are the technical details for those interested


```
Key derivation function used scrypt with salt
```
```
Encryption algorithm used AES–256 using GCM
```
What does the vault limit exceeded error mean

Each vault using Obsidian Sync has a maximum size of 4gb. This error indicates your vault has exceeded that
limit in size. Don’t forget attachments and version history contributes to the maximum, so you may exceed your
4gb limit even if your vault’s actual size is less than 4gb.

If you see this error, Obsidian can help you identify and purge large files from the Vault. Go to the Obsidian Sync
settings in Preferences = Sync and look for the “Vault size over limit” options.

##### Obsidian Publish

Obsidian Publish™ is a paid hosting service for your notes.

For instructions on how to publish your notes from within the Obsidian app, refer to the [[PublishPublish
plugin]].

### Privacy

You have total control over what to publish via the [[PublishPublish plugin]] - either your entire vault or just
selected notes within your vault. As for any notes you choose not to publish, you can be confident that those
notes remain completely private, and Obsidian Publish has no knowledge of them.

### Backing up

Please note that Obsidian Publish is not to be used as a backup for your content. Make sure you always have a
personal backup copy of your site using your preferred backup method. Our efforts on Obsidian Publish will be
more focused on functionality, ease of use, and site availability.

### Demo

There’s a good chance that you’re already viewing this article on our official site powered by Obsidian Publish.

If not, you can visit it here httpspublish.obsidian.mdhelp.

### What’s included

The Obsidian Publish service lets you create your site directly from within the Obsidian app by choosing the
notes you want to publish.

To c u s t o m i ze yo u r s i t e , yo u c a n c h o o s e b e t we e n l i g h t a n d d a r k m o d e , a n d a l s o t o g g l e b e t we e n re a d a b l e l i n e
length and full page length.

There are several components which can be turned on or off from the [[PublishPublish plugin]]. Changes to
these options will be reflected on your published site once the cache clears, typically within 5 minutes.


Navigation

Enabling this option adds a navigation sidebar displaying all published pages and the folders that contain them.
Viewers will see the current open note highlighted, and can click on any other note to navigate.

Search bar

Adds a search bar to page. This bar can be used to search for pages, aliases, and headings within pages. It does
not currently search through the full text content of the site.

Graph view

Displays a local graph of the page currently open. This uses the same rendering engine as the [Graph view]
plugin in Obsidian.

Ta b l e o f c o n t e n t s

Displays a table of contents for the page currently open. The list is generated from headings within the page,
similar to the [Outline] plugin. Viewers navigating the note will see the corresponding heading highlighted as
they scroll, and can click on another heading to immediately navigate to it.

Backlinks

Displays a section at the end of each page called “Linked to this page”, containing backlinks from other pages. If
there are no backlinks, the section will not be displayed.

Ta g s

When the reader clicks on a tag, they can see a list of other pages that includes the same tag.

Hover preview

When hovering over links, their content is displayed within a popup box. This works similarly to the [Page
preview] plugin in Obsidian.

Custom CSS

To c u s t o m i ze t h e s t y l i n g o f yo u r s i t e , yo u c a n u p l o a d a publish.css. This file must be stored in the root folder
of your site. You can use your existing theme and add some extra tweaks for publish in publish.css.

Favicon

To c h a n g e t h e fav i c o n o f yo u r s i t e , yo u c a n u p l o a d png icons of any size in the format of favicon-32.png or
favicon-32x32.png. You can also upload the file favicon.ico. These files can be stored in any folder. The
current recommendation (as of 2020) is to provide sizes 32 × 32 , 128x128 , 152 × 152 , 167x167 , 180x180 ,
192x192 , and 196x196.

Custom JS


If you wish to execute your own JavaScript code to change the visitor experience, or add various integrations like
Discus!, Discourse, etc. you can do so by uploading publish.js inside the root of your vault. Note that these
scripts will only run for visitors to your custom domain.

Disallow search engine indexing

This option adds a meta noindex tag to all your pages so search engines like Google does not index your site.
Note that search engines won’t be able to index your site anyway if it’s password protected.

Google Analytics

If you wish to setup Google Analytics for your site, first make sure your local laws and regulations allows. Then,
you just need to put the tracking code, in the form of UA-XXXXX-Y into the text box and your site will
automatically track page views. Note that Google Analytics is only available to visitors from your custom domain.

When testing Google Analytics, please make sure to disable any ad-blocking browser extensions like uBlock
Origin which blocks Google Analytics scripts from running.

Also, Obsidian Publish isn’t directly compatible with Google Tag Manager at the moment - you can set it up using
custom javascript if you wish to use Google Tag Manager instead of Google Analytics.

### Custom domain

You can setup a custom domain or subdomain for your Obsidian Publish site. Cur rently, we don’t yet have a way
to provision SSL certificate on your behalf, so you need to resort to either an SSL-enabled server of your own, or
to setup your site on CloudFlare, which provides SSL for free.

You can also setup Obsidian Publish as a sub-URL of a site you own. For example, httpsmysite.commy-
notes. To achieve this, you must host your own server and proxy all requests to our server at
httpspublish.obsidian.md.

Continue reading for setup details.

##### CloudFlare setup

The easiest way to setup a custom domain or subdomain is by making an account with CloudFlare and letting
CloudFlare manage your domain. This allows you to add SSL to your site for free, as well as ensure your site is
fast wherever in the world it’s accessed from. Typically users will host their Obsidian Publish content on a root
domain (e.g. mysite.com ) or an immediate subdomain (e.g. notes.mysite.com ). These instructions work
for both cases.

```
1. Open Cloudflare to the domain you wish to add Publish to (e.g. mysite.com , even if you want a
subdomain like notes.mysite.com ).
2. Go to DNS and click Add Record. Select CNAME, and in ‘name’ enter the domain or subdomain you wish
(e.g. notes.mysite.com ). In ‘target’, enter the value publish-main.obsidian.md. Do not include
your personal sub-URL in this value, as Obsidian Publish handles this from your configuration.
3. Go to SSLTLS and set the SSLTLS encryption mode to Full. This will configure the SSLTLS certificate
automatically.
```

Once you are done with configuring CloudFlare, you can head to your site options in Obsidian, and set the URL to
your domain or subdomain. This allows our server to associate the domain to your site.

Troubleshooting If your custom domain setup ends up in a redirect loop, it ’s likely that the encryption mode in
CloudFlare to Flexible instead of Full.

If you wish to configure both mysite.com and [httpwww.mysite.com](httpwww.mysite.com) to Obsidian Publish, you will need to create
a Page Rule as follows

- URL match [httpwww.mysite.com](httpwww.mysite.com)
- Foward URL - 301 Permanent Redirect
- Redirect URL httpsmysite.com$1

Once you create the page rule, you should also create a CNAME record for [httpwww.mysite.com](httpwww.mysite.com) just like you
created for mysite.com

##### Proxyredirect setup

If you wish to host your own web server and setup your own SSL encryption, you can choose this option. If you
are already hosting a website under your domain or subdomain, you can also use this option and setup your
website to load your Obsidian Publish site under a specific URL path, instead of hosting the full site.

Simply proxy all requests under that URL path to httpspublish.obsidian.mdserve
url=mysite.commy-notes... and configure the site options in Obsidian to the same URL path by
setting Custom URL to mysite.commy-notes.

NGINX

```
location my-notes {
proxy_pass httpspublish.obsidian.mdserveurl=mysite.commy-notes;
proxy_ssl_server_name on;
}
```
Apache

Add to .htaccess 

Note mod_rewrite must be enabled, and you may also need to configure SSLProxyEngine

Netlify

```
[[redirects]]
from = httpsmysite.commy-notes
to = httpspublish.obsidian.mdserveurl=mysite.commy-notessplat
status = 200
force = true
```
```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^my-notes(.)$ httpspublish.obsidian.mdserveurl=mysite.commy-notes$1 [L,P]
```

Vercel

In vercel.json configure rewrites

```
{
...
rewrites [
{
source my-notes,
destination httpspublish.obsidian.mdserveurl=mysite.commy-notes
},
{
source my-notespath,
destination httpspublish.obsidian.mdserveurl=mysite.commy-notespath
}
]
}
```
Supported HTTP X-Headers

Alternatively, if your proxy service does not allow query paths, you can use httpspublish.obsidian.md
with a custom header x-obsidian-custom-domain set to your site url mysite.commy-subpath.

##### Custom domain post-setup issues

Once you setup your custom domain, if you’ve visited your site from your previous
httpspublish.obsidian.mdslug link, you may have to clear your browser cache for certain things (like
fonts, graphs, or password access) to work properly. This is due to the cross-domain security restrictions that
are imposed by modern browsers. The good news is that readers of your site should never run into issue this if
you only let visitors use your custom domain.

##### Redirect old site to custom domain

If you’d like to redirect your visitors from the old publish.obsidian.md site to your new custom domain, there
is an option you can enable in the custom domain settings page which will do just that.

### Coming up

Obsidian Publish is still in its early days. Here are some features we plan to add

```
Full custom domain support (with SSL certificate provisioning).
Full text search.
More built-in themes.
```
Please let us know if you have any Obsidian Publish feature requests by submitting a forum request here.

### Pricing

For the pricing of Obsidian Publish, please visit our pricing page.


### Te c h n i c a l d e t a i l s

Obsidian Publish uses Cloudflare as the CDN (content delivery network) to distribute your site across the globe
for a faster access. This involves caching copies of the files of your site on some of the 200+ data centers to
ensure the lowest latency for your readers and the site remain speedy and loads fast even if your viewer lives far
away from our primary servers.

However, this does mean that when you change site settings, publish new content, or unpublish content, visitors
might not see the latest version for a short while. Currently, our cache is configured to persist for an hour before
it has to be “re-validated” to ensure the content hasn’t changed.

If you’ve just published items but you are still seeing an older version, you can typically perform a “hard refresh”
by holding the reload button and choosing “Hard reload” in the dropdown menu. Failing that, you can try clearing
the browser cache or disabling cache using the developer tools in the network tab.

##### Hosting media files

While Obsidian Publish allows you to upload video clips, it is not optimized for video delivery. As such, your
visitors may find that the videos on your site may not deliver a great experience.

We recommend using a proper video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos for Obsidian
Publish. The advantages of using a proper video hosting site includes

- Automatic re-encoding ensures that your videos can be played on all mobile devices regardless of what
encoding format you used in your original file.
- Dynamic quality adjustment based on bandwidth availability and ensures that videos can be played smoothly
without constantly pausing for “buffering”.
- High efficiency video compression to ensure that visitors don’t blow through their data cap when viewing your
site.
- Global CDN allowing your videos to be loaded fast regardless of where your visitor is located in the world.

### Obsidian

##### iOS app

The iOS app is now publicly available, and a link to the app store listing can be found at
httpsobsidian.mdmobile

## Where are my vaults stored

If you choose, you can store your vaults in iCloud Drive. These vaults can be found in your iCloud Drive folder,
under an app folder named “Obsidian” that shows the Obsidian logo.

If you choose not to use iCloud for a vault, then it will be stored in the sandboxed file system of the Obsidian app.
The local vaults are accessible from any other apps that support picking a folder from the file system. As such,
apps like Working Copy can be used to sync with Obsidian’s local vaults.

==Be aware that if you choose to store your vault locally, they will be automatically deleted by iOS when you
uninstall Obsidian’s app.==

## Sync

### Quick start

If you already have a vault on your desktop, here’s the two ways to sync your vault to mobile and access it

```
[[#iCloud Drive Sync]]
[[#Obsidian Sync]]
```

The two current officially supported sync solutions are iCloud and Obsidian Sync.
Working Copy (git) is another alternative that has been tested to work with Obsidian on iOS.

Currently, there is no known support for the following sync services on iOS yet

- Dropbox
- Google Drive
- OneDrive
- Syncthing

If you find out a way to sync using these services on iOS with Obsidian, we would be glad if you can join our
Discord server and teach us how to set it up.

In theory, any third party sync providers that can provide background-sync for a specific folder on your device
should be able to work, but we are not aware of any other than Working Copy. This is due to the limitations of the
highly complex mechanism of cross-app file sharing in iOS, unlike Android which allows easy cross-app file
sharing. Because of this, most third party sync providers don’t have a proper implementation for background
sync on iOS.

Currently Obsidian does not support third party sync providers that expose a virtual file system through
FileProvider. We will be attempting this in the future as an improvement.

### Obsidian Sync

You can follow the same steps as Android’s sync as shown below, making sure that you create a non-iCloud
folder as we do not recommend using both Obsidian Sync and iCloud Sync concurrently, which has been
reported to cause data loss due to [[Obsidian Sync#Third party syncrace conditions]].

![[Android app#Obsidian Sync]]

### iCloud Drive Sync

To s e t u p a new synced vault through iCloud Drive

```
1. Start the iOS app and choose “Create a new vault”;
2. On desktop, using the “Open another vault” option, point to the new vault location in iCloud.
```
To s e t u p a n existing vault to be synced through iCloud Drive

```
1. Start the app and choose “Create a new vault”;
```
```
2. Name it the same as your desktop vault to make [[Using obsidian URIinter-vault URIs]] work;
```
```
3. Wait for iCloud to sync this empty folder to your desktop;
```
```
4. Copy and paste everything under your vault to this empty folder, this will now be your synced folder
location;
```
```
5. On desktop, using the “Open another vault” option, point to the new vault location in iCloud;
```
```
6. Wait for iCloud to sync everything to your mobile device.
```

### Working Copy

You can alter natively setup Working Copy to use Git to sync your vault on iOS. To do this, you should create an
empty local vault on your device first, then you can “Setup Folder Sync” and select a local vault inside the
Obsidian app. Then, you can manually commit & push.

### Third party sync support

Many users asks why Obsidian for Mobile doesn’t support their preferred sync solution. Here’s a brief
explanation on the current state of mobile sync support.

The thing about Obsidian that’s different from other apps like 1Writer and iA Writer is that Obsidian works on top
of a vault rather than a single note. Many of the core Obsidian functionality depend on the whole vault and all the
files inside, such as the link auto-complete, image embedding, tag pane, backlinks, and all the cross-note
functionality.

In contrast, most Markdown editing apps simply “open” a single note, let the user perform edits, then save the
note back. Because of this, the OS and third party sync providers typically only provide an API for
accessingworking with a single file, but not so much for working with a vault (folder of files with potentially
subfolders).

For sync, a regular markdown editor app can simply implement the basic “download file when you open a
selected file” and “upload the file back when you press save”. Obsidian has to download the whole vault to be
useful, and keep track of all the modified files (like for example, when you perform a file rename, we might
update a bunch of other files for links that has changed due to the rename). On top of that, we need a way to
monitor for changes through the sync solution to be able to update our internal caches when files change, to
provide accurate links.

Keeping all that in sync with a third party sync provider would be quite tedious - and this is actually part of the
reason why most sync providers don’t make a proper sync client for mobile and you have to use a third party app
(like DropSync or FolderSync) to do it. Unfortunately, such apps don’t exist on iOS because of app sandboxing.

## Known issues

### iCloud folder on macOS

If you find yourself unable to drag & drop things into the iCloud folder in Finder on macOS, please download the
latest Obsidian Desktop release from httpsobsidian.md as it contains a fix for this issue. Once it’s installed,
running the app should automatically cause iCloud to update the folder permissions. If this does not work right
away, you may need to restart your machine.

### Paste menu sometimes not appearing

Some users runs into an issue where tapping on the cursor does not show the paste menu. As a workaround, you
can use the three-finger tap gesture to trigger a global edit menu which can be used to paste into the text.

##### Mobile app beta


## Public release

The mobile apps are now officially publicly available. You can find the download links for the public versions at
httpsobsidian.mdmobile

## Documentation

For more details on how to use Obsidian for Mobile, including guides for setting up sync, see [Obsidian Mobile].

## Insider builds

If you’re a holder of the [Catalyst license], you may wish to join our [[Insider buildsinsider builds]] for mobile.

email, we ask Catalyst users who would like to beta test to go through the following steps

### Step 1 join our Discord

First of all, please join our Discord.

### Step 2 claim your Catalyst badge to access #insider-build-mobile channel

If you don’t have your badge yet, [[Catalyst license#Discord badgeyou can get it in your Account page]].

### Step 3 get the app via TestFlight (iOS) or APK (Android)

Once you get your badge, you should be able to see the #insider-build-mobile channel along with regular
channels like #general and #publish.

To f i n d t h e i n s t r u c t i o n s fo r i n s t a l l i n g t h e m o b i l e a p p s , g o t o #insider-build-mobile , and open pinned
messages.

On Discord web and desktop, you can open pinned messages of a channel by clicking on the pushpin icon near
the search bar at the top. On Discord mobile, you’ll need to swipe left to reveal the right sidebar and tap on the
pushpin icon at the top.

For the iOS app, look for the TestFlight link. Make sure to open the link on your iPhone or iPad, rather than on
your computer. For the Android app, install the APK from the latest pinned messages if there are several of them.

## How do I provide feedback

Before reporting an issue or submitting a feature request, please visit the list of known issues on our forum to
see what’s already known and on the roadmap.

##### Android app

The Android app is now publicly available, and a link to the Play store listing can be found at
httpsobsidian.mdmobile

## Where are my vaults stored

On Android, the Obsidian home folder is stored in the public documents folder under DocumentsObsidian.
The public Documents folder is typically stored in SD card or emulated storage.

Any folder in this home folder will be considered a vault. If you sync or copy a vault folder into this directory, it
can be recognized when you open Obsidian.

## Sync

On Android, you may choose to use [Obsidian Sync] to synchronize your files, or use any third party sync
provider that can perform sync in the background.

### Obsidian Sync

As with Obsidian desktop, we provide our built-in paid [Obsidian Sync] service.

To s e t u p a sy n c e d va u l t t h ro u g h O b s i d i a n S y n c , f i r s t c re a t e a n e w e m p t y l o c a l va u l t. Yo u s h o u l d n a m e i t t h e
same as your desktop app to make [[Using obsidian URIinter-vault URIs]] work.

Once the empty vault is open, open the left sidebar, tap the settings button, and setup Obsidian Sync just like
you did on Desktop

```
1. Login to your Obsidian account in the Account tab.
```
```
2. Enable the Sync core plugin.
```
```
3. Open settings, and choose the “Sync” tab under “Plugin options”.
```
```
4. Choose the remote vault to sync with.

indicator just like it shows on the desktop app. Tap on it to get more information, such as viewing the sync log to
debug any issues.


### Third party sync

You can also use your prefer red sync solution to keep the local folder on your phone in sync with other devices.

There are apps on the Play Store that let you sync a folder on your phone with other devices, for example
Dropsync or FolderSync.

## Storage Permission

When starting Obsidian, you may notice that it prompts for permission to access your device’s documents and
media.

In an ideal world, we’d prefer to only ask for access rights to the vault folders you choose. However, Android’s
privacy-friendly file permission API (also known as “scoped storage”) has a few restrictions that makes it
impossible for Obsidian to function properly.

The two biggest roadblocks are

```
Scoped storage performs many extra permission checks for every single file access, causing significant
performance degradation when opening and using Obsidian.
```
```
Scoped storage does not provide a way to watch for external changes, which is critical when using
Obsidian with a third-party synchronization tool.
```
Google specifically gives instructions for developers of this kind of apps a special permission. Obsidian belongs
to two categories in the list of exceptions “document management apps”, and “on-device file search”. Read more
about it here.

##### Obsidian

## What is Obsidian

Obsidian is a both a Markdown editor and a knowledge base app.

Used in the most basic way, you can edit and preview Markdown files. But its true power lies in managing
densely networked knowledge base.

How do we start creating a network, you ask Let’s first start making some [[Internal linkinternal links]]!

## How we’re different

== _We want you to own and control your data_ ==

We believe in plain text for something as important as your knowledge base. You don’t want to put your own
brain over someone else’s neck, do you Treat your second brain the same way.

Sync is only a utility to facilitate working on multiple devices, the data will always primarily live on your hard disk.

When the file system replaces the cloud, you get flexible options to work with your files you can back them up
with Dropbox, use Git to do versioning, or encrypt your disk for security. Whatever works on your file system will
work on your Obsidian knowledge base.

== _Links are first-class citizens_ ==

Links and connections are crucial to discovering the relations between what we know.

Obsidian greatly values this, and encourages it with [Internal link] and [Graph view], among other things.

As John Locke puts it...

```
The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three
```
1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.
2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another


```
so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations.
```
3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence this is
called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.
- John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)

Hierarchy gives us No. 1, and linking gives us No. 2. We’re still unsure what No. 3 entails in the context of note-
taking, but it might have something to do with programming or macros.

== _Your own toolkit_ ==

Note-taking is a highly personal activity. Naturally there is no single all-encompassing solution for everyone.

Instead of providing you with an opinionated and assembled product, [Obsidian] gives you a foundation and
numerous functional building blocks to discover and build your own solution.

The foundation is to be able to view files, edit them, and search them. For the minimalist, that’s enough.

On top of that, you can add isolated, independent building blocks to add features to your note-taking

```
If you’re taking class notes, [Audio recorder] and LaTeX math might be useful;
```
```
If you’re taking work notes, [Slides] and [Backlinks] may come in handy;
```
```
If you’re a researcher, [Graph view] and [Word count] might be essential to your toolkit.
```
We don’t expect plugins to be the silver bullet to solve all the problems, but it does get us closer than a monolith
solution, without all the features that you don’t need cluttering the interface.

We support [[Customizing CSScustom CSS]] and have a [[Community pluginsbeta plugin API]], which will
enable even more interface customization and support less common use cases.

##### Search

![[Search.png]]

Search is a powerful feature, and has the potential to be confusing. In most cases, if you just type what you want
to find, it will work. But search has many capabilities for narrowing down to find exactly what you want.

## Quick tips

## Start searching


You can invoke search by pressing Ctrl-Shift-F or Cmd-Shift-F. You can also customize this hotkey in
Settings = Hotkeys. When search is invoked, focus will be automatically put in the search bar so you can start
typing your query right away.

### Search selected text

After you select text, you can search for it by simply invoking search like above.

## Search history

Obsidian will remember your most recently used search queries.

These queries will be presented to you when your search query is empty. You can click on any one of them to
search for it again, allowing you to easily re-run previous queries.

## Search Settings

There are a couple of toggles available while searching

```
Match case toggle case sensitive matching, but note that it can be overridden on a per-search basis
using the match-case and ignore-case operators explained above.
Explain search term will show you what the search query actually does in plain terms.
Collapse results will toggle between just showing matching note names and showing the lines in
which matches appear. These extended results can be toggled for each note by clicking on the folding
triangle next to the file name.
Show more context will expand the display of the matches to show more text around the match.
Change sort order sorts the results by various orders, similar to how files are sorted in the [File
explorer].
```
## Copy search results

To q u i c k l y a n d e a s i l y t a ke yo u r s e a rc h re s u l t s t o a l i s t , u s e t h e “c o py s e a rc h re s u l t ” o p t i o n.

You can customize whether you want to show paths, which link style to use (wikilink or Markdown link), and how
you want your list to appear.

## Embed search results

You can embed search results in a note.

For example, if you write

```
query
```

```
embed OR search
```
You should see this embedded search view (note it doesn’t work on [Obsidian Publish] as of 20200118)

```
embed OR search
```
## Search syntax

### Combining sub-queries

When crafting a search query, remember that clicking “Explain Search Term” will give an explanation of what is
being searched for, which can be very useful when debugging a complicated search.

```
Words in the search query separated by space will be searched independently in each note. For example
foo bar will find a note that includes both foo and bar anywhere in it.
Quoted strings can be used to search multiple consecutive words separated by space, or in other
words, a phrase. So, searching for foo bar with quotes will only find notes that include those words
next to each other. You can use backslash  to escape double quotes if you actually want to search for a
string that includes quotes. And  will do the same for backslash.
Boolean operations can be used. Use OR to match one or another. Use - to negate a query. The space
character is used for boolean “and”.
For example foo OR bar will find all notes that contain either of those words, they don’t have to
be in the same note. foo -bar will find all notes that contain foo , but not if they also contain
bar.
Parenthesis can be used to group boolean operations. For example ((a OR b) (c OR d)). This can be
useful when crafting complex searches to make sure things happen in the order you want.
Regular expressions (regex) can now be used in search. Use forward slash to denote a regular expression.
For example [a-z]{3}. Obsidian accepts the JavaScript flavor regular expressions. You can learn
more about it here.
```
### Search operators

Several special operators are available. Some operators allow nesting queries using parenthesis, for example
file(to be OR -2B). You can use - to exclude specific results from search, for example foo -
tag#bar.

```
file(...) will perform the following subquery on the file name. For example file.jpg. If you use
Zettelkasten-style UIDs, this can be useful for narrowing a time range, for example file202007 for files
created in July of 2020.
path(...) will perform the following subquery on the file path, absolute from the root. For example
pathDaily Notes2020-07.
content(...) will perform the following subquery on the file content. For example contenthappy
cat.
match-case(...) and ignore-case(...) will override the case sensitive match logic for the
following subquery.
```

```
tag will search for your specified tag within a file, for example tag#work. This is faster and more
accurate than searching for the tag in plaintext #work , as it uses the cached information and ignores text
in code blocks and sections that aren’t markdown text.
line(...) will perform the subquery on a line-by-line basis, rather than a file-by-file basis. For
example, if you search for foo bar , this could match a file that has foo in the first paragraph and bar
in the last paragraph. Searching for line(foo bar) will only match if foo and bar are on the same
line.
block(...) will perform the subquery on a block-by-block basis, where each block defined as a
markdown block, typically separated by empty lines or list items. This is expensive computationally as it
requires parsing each file, which means this is likely slower than other modes.
section(...) will perform the subquery on a section-by-section basis, where each section is the text
between two headings, including the first heading.
task(...) will perform the subquery only on each [[Format your notes#Task listtask]] and on a block-
by-block basis. Use task to match all tasks.
task-todo(...) will perform the subquery only on each uncompleted [[Format your notes#Task
listtask]] and on a block-by-block basis. Use task-todo to match all uncompleted tasks.
task-done(...) will perform the subquery only on each completed [[Format your notes#Task
listtask]] and on a block-by-block basis. Use task-done to match all completed tasks.
```
##### Note composer

The Note composer plugin allows you to easily merge two note or extract part of a note into its own note.

## Merge

When working with the file, you can choose “Merge entire file with...” in the More Options menu.

Alternatively, you can open [Command palette] and invoke the command “Note composer Merge current file
with another file...”.

This will bring up a menu to choose a file to merge into. Once you confirm the merge, all links to the current note
will be updated to the merged file.

The current note will be merged to the bottom by default; you can use Shift-Enter instead of Enter to
merge it to the top.

## Extract

When selecting text, you can either right click on it, select “Extract current selection”, or use the [Command
palette] to find the “Note composer Extract current selection...” command.

Similar to merging, this will bring up a menu to choose a file to extract into. If no result can be found, a new note
will be created. If you want to create a new note instead of using the first result, press Ctrl-Enter (or Cmd-
Enter on macOS).

## Options


Note Composer has a few helpful plugin options.

### Te x t a f t e r m o v i n g

After you extract a piece of text, it’s often a good idea to leave a link to the new file. By default, a link is created.
But you can also change this option to have an embed created for you, or insert nothing at all.

### Te m p l a t e f i l e

When merging or extracting, instead of just sending over the content, you can also apply a template file to it.

This template file can contain the following variables

```
{{content}}  this is where the content will be placed. If you do not include this variable, the content will
automatically be placed at the bottom of the template.
```
```
{{fromTitle}}  the name of the note where the new note comes from.
```
```
{{newTitle}}  the title of the new file. Convenient if you prefer to have a heading at the top of the file
that’s the same as the file name.
```
```
{{dateFORMAT}}  you can add multiple dates with your custom format. For example, you can do
{{dateYYYY-MM-DD}} and it will resolve to the date or time when the note gets created.
```
### Confirm file merge

Merging files will delete the file and is destructive, so by default we ask for your confirmation. If you prefer, you
can choose to skip this confirmation.

In case you accidentally merged something and want to get it back, consider using the [File recovery] plugin to
recover it.

##### File explorer

The File explorer shows [[Accepted file formatsthe list of files Obsidian can recognize]] in your vault. You can
open notes, [create notes] and folders, and [rename notes] in it. Right clicking on a note or directory in the File
explorer will bring up appropriate options, such as renaming or making a copy. This is also the best way to set
your default folder for when you [Embed files].

It’s one of the crucial plugins that we recommend you to keep enabled.

### Usage tips

```
1. If the list of files is cluttering the interface though, you can close it
```
![[Pasted image 15.png]]

```
1. You can drag and drop to put one file into another folder.
```

```
2. You can use the sor t icon at the top to sor t files by file name or last modified time.
```
##### Backlinks

The backlinks plugin shows how the current note is referenced in other notes.

After enabling it, you’ll see the backlink count in the status bar.

In the right side bar (if it’s expanded), you should also see a panel that shows where the current note gets linked

![[Pasted image 9.png]]

Upon expanding the “Unlinked mentions” section, you can also see where the name of the note gets mentioned,
but not explicitly linked (in other words, mentioned without the square brackets).

##### Te m p l a t e s

The Templates plugin lets you quickly insert snippets of text into your current note.

### Set up template folder

Each template snippet is just a normal Markdown note, like everything else in Obsidian.

To d e s i g n a t e t e m p l a t e f i l e s , p u t t h e m i n t o a fo l d e r, a n d c h o o s e t h a t fo l d e r i n S e t t i n g s =  Te m p l a t e s =  “ Te m p l a t e
folder location” after enabling the plugin

### Insert a template

After setting up the folder location, using the ribbon icon to insert the template. As always, you can also set a
hotkey for this option, or use the command palette to access it.

The template snippet will be inserted in the current caret position, with special text replaced by their actual value
at the time of the insertion (see below).

### Insert title

If you want to insert the title of a note, you can set it in a template with {{title}}.

### Insert date and time

In the plugin settings of Template, you can also set a date format and a time format.

After setting these formats, {{date}} and {{time}} in the template files will be replaced by the formatting
current time.

For formatting syntax documentation, please see here.

_Tip if you want to have two date formats or two time formats, you can use the other {{time}} as the second
{{date}} , or {{date}} as the second {{time}}._


### One-off date formats

In addition to {{date}} and {{time}} , which will work in all template files, you can also write
{{dateYYYY-MM-DD}} to insert a date with a certain format just once. This will override the {{date}}
format. Anything after  will be considered part of the date format.

{{timeHHmm}} works similarly.

### Using custom date formats elsewhere

Currently, dates like {{dateYYYY-MM-DD}} and {{timeHHmm}} also work in the template file of the [Daily
notes] and [Zettelkasten prefixer] plugins. However, {{date}} and {{time}} do not work yet.

##### Graph view

Shows a graph representation of the [[Internal linkinternal links]] between your notes.

Notes with more notes referencing it appear as bigger nodes on the graph.

![[Pasted image 10.png]]

### Visualization tips

```
You can hover each node to highlight its connec tions, fading ever ything else.
You can drag nodes around to rear range the graph. This may be helpful if some nodes are overlaying
others.
```
### Navigation tips

```
To zo o m , yo u c a n u s e m o u s e w h e e l s c ro l l , a s we l l a s t h e + and - keys.
To p a n a ro u n d , d r a g t h e b a c kg ro u n d o r u s e t h e ke y b o a rd a r row ke ys.
Hold Shift while navigating with the keyboard to speed things up.
```
### Custom CSS

Since the graph is rendered using canvas and WebGL, [[Customizing CSSCSS]] is unable to affect things
like nodes and links. To customize graph view, we have provided a way to convert CSS colors into WebGL
commands.

##### The following CSS classes are supported

```
.graph-view.color-fill
.graph-view.color-fill-tag (theme-dependent)
.graph-view.color-fill-attachment (theme-dependent)
.graph-view.color-arrow
```

```
.graph-view.color-circle
.graph-view.color-line
.graph-view.color-text
.graph-view.color-fill-highlight
.graph-view.color-line-highlight
.graph-view.color-fill-unresolved
```
```
theme-dependent means you may have to add .theme-dark or .theme-light to style it for different
themes. See [[#Custom CSS#Defaults]] for explanation.
```
##### The following CSS rules are supported

```
.graph-view.color-class {
 Supports all CSS color directives, like #HEX, rgb and rgba 
color #FFF;
color #FFFFFF;
color rgb(0, 0, 0);
color rgba(0, 0, 0, 1);
 Opacity (similar to rgba) will make the color transparent 
opacity 0.5;
}
```
##### Defaults

These CSS rules are the ones Obsidian use by default. You may override any of them using an identical or more
specific CSS rule. This applies especially to .color-fill-tag and .color-fill-attachment As a last
resort, add !important to the end of your rule.

```
.graph-view.color-fill,
.theme-dark .graph-view.color-fill-tag,
.theme-light .graph-view.color-fill-tag,
.theme-dark .graph-view.color-fill-attachment,
.theme-light .graph-view.color-fill-attachment,
.graph-view.color-arrow,
.graph-view.color-circle,
```

```
.graph-view.color-line,
.graph-view.color-text,
.graph-view.color-fill-highlight,
.graph-view.color-line-highlight,
.graph-view.color-fill-unresolved {}
```
##### Ta g p a n e

Adds a panel on the right that displays all the tags you have, along with their tag count.

When clicking on a tag, a search for the tag is activated. To ==toggle a tag== in search, Ctrl-click it instead.

### Sorting

The tags are sorted from most frequently used to least frequently used. You can change the sort order to
alphabetical or reverse it.

### Nested tags

If you write your tags like #inboxto-read and #inboxprocessing , you can enable “show nested tags” to
view them as a tree instead of a flat list.

Under the default flat view, the tag pane will look like

- inboxto-read
- inboxprocessing

Under the nested tag view, the tag pane will look like

- inbox
- to-read
- processing

##### Zettelkasten prefixer

Adds a new button to the left pane, which can be used to create a new file and prefix it for you using the current
time. This can be beneficial if you are a follower of the Zettelkasten UID-in-filename method.

The default format is 12-digit timestamp, e.g. “202001010000”.


### Te m p l a t e s

You can define a [[Templatestemplate file]] for your Zettelkasten notes. This file will be copied when a new
Zettel note is created.

For the Zettelkasten prefixer plugin, {{date}} and {{time}} do not work. Please use {{dateYYYY-MM-
DD}} and {{timeHHmm}} in your template.

##### Word count

Word count is a simple plugin that shows the word count of your current note in the bottom status bar.

It works for CJK characters too (Chinese, Japanese, and Korean), in which words are not separately by spaces
but rather glued together.

##### Outline

The outline plugin shows the list of headings for the current note, and allows you to navigate to another section
by clicking on a heading.

##### Workspaces

The Workspaces plugin lets you save and load “workspaces”. Each workspace includes pane layout, sidebar state
(expanded or collapsed), and file open states.

![[Pasted image 19.png]]

### Save a workspace

Either click on the workspace icon in the ribbon to open “Manage workspaces”.

Give the current layout a new name, click on “Save”, and it will appear in the list below.

### Load a workspace

To l o a d o r re s t o re a wo r ks p a c e , e i t h e r o p e n “ M a n a g e wo r ks p a c e s ” a n d c l i c k o n t h e “ Lo a d ” b u t t o n n ex t t o t h e
workspace you wish to load, or use the “Load workspaces” command to bring up a command-palette-like
interface to search and choose workspaces.

### Commands

This plugin has two commands that you can access through [Command palette] manage workspaces and load
workspaces. You can also define hotkeys for them.

##### Publish

The Publish plugin lets you publish notes from your vault onto your site, all from within the Obsidian app.

For more information about the Obsidian Publish™ service, what’s included, how it works, and privacy, see the


[Obsidian Publish] add-on service.

### Enable the plugin

From within Obsidian = Settings = Plugin, enable the Publish plugin. After that, a Publish icon (which looks like
a paper plane) will appear in the ribbon pane.

Once enabled, you can also set a hotkey for this option, or use the command palette to access it.

### Set up and Configure your site

Within the Publish plugin, you’ll see an option to create a site by entering a unique site ID. Once published, your
site will be available at httpspublish.obsidian.md{site-id}.

After creating a unique site ID, you’ll have the option to give your site a name, select a home page, set a theme,
and toggle various components such as graph view, table of contents, etc. You can toggle these options by
clicking on the gear icon near your site name at the top of the Publish plugin.

### Select files for publishing

After setting up your site, you can now publish your notes!

With a fresh, empty site, all your notes will appear under the “New” section, meaning they are new to your site.
At this point, you may choose which files you want to publish, and then click the “Publish” button.

==Privacy note Obsidian Publish has no awareness (nor retention) of any notes you choose not to publish (nor
any notes you subsequently remove from your published site).==

##### YAML suppor t for Publish

As of 0.12.12, you can use YAML to flag notes to be published. (You can read more about YAML in Obsidian
[[YAML front matterhere]].)

If you set publish true , then new files will be automatically selected the next time you publish changes.

If you set publish false , then the file will not be visble when publishing changes, and will not show up in
newchanged files. If this file had been previously published, you will see an option to delete it instead.

If you do not use YAML to flag publish files, the default behaviour is to automatically select changed files, but not
new files.

### Make changes

As you make changes to notes that have already been published, those changes will be automatically selected
when you open the Publish plugin dialog. You may uncheck any files you wish not to publish to your site.

### Change site options


You can change various site options by clicking on the gear icon near your site name when in the “Publish
changes” dialogue.

##### Metadata

In this section, you can set site name, home page file (the file visitors see when they land on your site), and
manage custom domain (please see [[Obsidian Publish#Custom domainthis guide]] to set up your custom
domain).

##### Appearance

Here you can change the theme between light and dark.

If you want more customization, you can look into setting up [[Obsidian Publish#Custom CSScustom CSS]] and
[[Obsidian Publish#Faviconfavicon]].

##### Reading experience

In this section, you can

```
Enable a special mode called “sliding windows” that looks like Andy Matuschak’s notes;
```
```
Enable page preview on hover like when using [Page preview] plugin in the app;
```
```
Configure whether you want readable line length and strict line breaks.
```
##### Components

Your site comes with a few components that you can toggle on or off. These include

```
File explorer (default on)
```
```
Local graph (default on)
```
```
Outline (default off)
```
```
Backlink at the bottom (default off)
```
```
Search bar (default off, requires file explorer)
```
##### Security

Here you can set passwords to protect your site. Once set, all visitors need to enter one of the passwords to
enter your site.

Multiple passwords facilitate sharing with multiple groups. When you no longer wish to share with one group of
visitors, you can simply delete that password. Each password can be named for your convenience as well.

As of 20210120, all notes on your site are protected by the same set of passwords.

### Add linked notes


The “Add linked” button allows you to include for publishing any notes in your vault that are referenced (linked
to) by any currently selected notes. This is a good way to ensure there are no dead links on your published site.

By way of example, let’s assume you select Note A for publishing. Supposing Note A has links to Note P, Note Q,
and Note R, then if you click the “Add linked” button, Notes P, Q, and R will all be selected for publishing along
with the currently selected Note A.

Each time you click the “Add linked” button, the Publish plugin will look for links within every currently selected
file to include for publication. Please be sure you review the list of selected files before clicking the “Publish”
button.

### Delete published notes

You always have the option of removing any notes that have been published to your site. Within the Publish
plugin, all published notes will be listed, of which anyall can be selected for removal. Deleting a note from your
site does not remove the note from your vault, thus giving you the option to re-publish the note again in the
future.

### Delete entire site

If you’d like to delete an entire site, click the switch-site (arrows) icon near the top of the Publish plugin. Then
click the X button to delete your site. Note this only removes your public site but does not affect any files in your
vault. You can always choose to re-publish your notes.

##### Quick switcher

The Quick switcher lets you jump to other notes without leaving your keyboard. The shortcut to invoke it is
CtrlCmd+O. Just start typing, and matching filenames will be selected. Use up and down arrows to navigate
the results, Enter to jump to a result, and Esc to exit the quick switcher. Holding down CmdCtrl will cause
the note to open in a new pane.

If you want to create a new note, typing a unique name will cause the Quick Switcher to create it. If the name is
similar enough to an existing note, the Quick Switcher will default to opening the original note. To avoid this,
holding down shift will force creation of a new note with whatever name is in the Quick Switcher. This can be
combined with CmdCtrl to create the new note in a new pane.

![[Pasted image 11.png]]

Before you enter anything, the top 5 most recently visited notes will be shown, so it’s also useful to quickly
switch two notes by doing CtrlCmd+O → Down arrow → Enter.

##### File recovery

File recovery is a core plugin to help you recover your data in case of all kind of accidents - user error, power
outage, or misbehaving plugins and scripts.

File recovery is default to enabled, because it’s too late to enable when you’ve already lost data.


## How it works

### Snapshots

As long as this plugin is enabled, full snapshots of what you’re working on get saved at fixed intervals (you can
configure this interval). Snapshots get deleted after a fixed amount of retention time.

This process is automatic. By default, snapshots are made every 5 minutes, and snapshots are kept for 7 days.

### Recovering

In case of data loss, here’s how you can find saved snapshots

```
1. Open settings;
```
```
2. Open the “File recovery” tab under “Plugin options”;
```
```
3. Click on the “View” button in “Snapshots” section;
```
```
4. In the search bar on the left, enter the name of file you want to recover. If the file name does not show it, it
means no snapshots were saved for that file;
```
```
5. After selecting a file in the dropdown, a list of snapshots will appear on the left. Select the one you want to
recover;
```
```
6. The content of that snapshot will show up on the right. You can click “Copy to clipboard” to copy the whole
thing, or cherry-pick some of the content.
```
## Options

### Snapshot interval

Minimal number of minutes between two snapshots. Default is 5 minutes.

### History length

Number of days to keep snapshots around for. Default is 7 days.

### Clear history

You also have the option to wipe all histor y. ==Please be careful as this ac tion is ir reversible.==

## Data storage

The file recovery data is stored in [[How Obsidian stores data#System directorysystem directory]] in case of
vault malfunctioning.


Please note that vaults are identified by their absolute path. If you’ve moved vault, you will need to move it back
to its previous position in order to restore the snapshots while the vault was there.

##### Markdown format converter

It allows you to convert from other variations of Markdown format and link convention to Obsidian format.

Right now you can convert

```
Roam #tags to [tags]
```
```
Roam ^^highlight^^ to ==highlight==
```
```
Bear highlight to ==highlight==.
```
```
Zettelkasten [[UID]] links to full links [[UID File Name]]
```
```
Zettelkasten [[UID]] links to pretty links [[UID File NameFile Name]] , which will show up as just
File Name
```
### Related

```
[Format your notes]
```
##### Outgoing links

The Outgoing Links plugin shows the links from the current note at a glance, as well as potential links to be
made. If you’re familiar with the [Backlinks] plugin, you can think of outgoing links as the opposite direction of
backlinks.

After enabling the plugin, you should see a new pane in the right sidebar, which contains two sections “Links”
and “Unlinked mentions”.

### Links

The Links sections show links to other files, headings, and blocks. Clicking on a link will take you to that file.

Each type will have its own icon for you to distinguish them; links to files that are not created yet have special
icons.

Underneath the title, you can also see the folder path of each file.

### Unlinked mentions

If any text in the current note matches the name or [[Add aliases to notealias]] of another note in your vault, you
can see the context, highlighted match, and a button to Link it under “Unlinked mentions”.

When you hover over the button, it will show the full path of the file if it’s not in the vault root. If you have multiple
files of the same name, this can help you distinguish them.


##### Random note

Random note does just that, opens a note at random from your Vault. Many people find this useful for surfacing
thoughts they had not considered in a long time, or spot checking for things that they may have forgotten to link.

After you enable the Random Note plugin, you can create a [[Custom hotkeyscustom hotkey]] that opens a note
at random.

##### Core plugins

One of the most powerful aspects of [Obsidian] is the ability to add new functionality via plugins. It comes with
several already, and many more are in development.

You can also build your own Obsidian plugin. See [Community plugins].

Plugins can be managed through the “Settings” button on the bottom left. Some of them have settings of their
own that can be configured by clicking on the gear that appears next to each plugin when it is activated.

##### Page preview

Page preview lets you preview a page when hovering an internal link, without needing to actually navigate to that
page.

![[Pasted image 13.png]]

This works on the preview pane. In the editor, you can hover a link while holding CtrlCmd , which will open the
preview too.

##### Starred notes

Starred notes are a convenient way of keeping important notes close at hand. Enabling the plugin will create a
star icon on the left panel, which brings up a list of starred notes.

To s t a r a f i l e , yo u h ave s e ve r a l o p t i o n s. Yo u c a n d o s o f ro m a r i g h t c l i c k i n t h e f i l e ex p l o re r, a c l i c k o n t h e o p t i o n s
menu of an open note, typing in the [command palette], or a hotkey that can be set in [Use hotkeys].

Starred files and searches can be reordered by dragging them around.

##### Daily notes

Daily Notes will create a new note that is automatically named with the current date. If it already exists, it will
open that note. This is a useful way to create a daily log, todo list, or a list of links to notes that you have created
on a specific day.

The date format and default folder for Daily Notes can be set in Settings = Plugins, by clicking the gear next to
the name. The default date format is “YYYY-MM-DD” (ISO format). This format means that a list of daily notes,
listed in alphabetical order, will also be in chronological order.

You can create a Daily Note either by clicking on the calendar icon in the left panel, or with the [Command
palette]. You can also set a hotkey in [Use hotkeys].

### Te m p l a t e s

You can define a [[Templatestemplate file]] for daily notes. This file will be copied into your daily note when it ’s
created, so it’s a good place to put tags or links you use every day.


For the daily notes plugin, {{date}} and {{time}} do not work. Please use {{dateYYYY-MM-DD}} and

##### Command palette

The Command Palette is enabled by default, as it is a very useful way to access nearly all the features of
Obsidian without having to remember key strokes. Type CtrlCmd+P to activate, then simply type in the name
of the command. If a command has a hotkey, it will appear in on the right side.

Custom shorcuts can be added to the Command Palette in Settings = Hotkeys. Click on the  icon to the right
of each key listed and type whatever key combination you would like.

### Settings

##### Pinned commands

You can set a few pinned commands that will appear at top of the command palette. This lets you choose them
without typing anything. It’s a good place to put your most frequently used commands.

Pinned commands are managed on the Command palette options screen under Plugin Options. You can add
pinned commands by entering the name in the “New pinned command” field. After you pick a command and hit
Enter , the command will be added to the list above. You can reorder the list or delete existing pinned
commands in the list.

### Usage tips

```
To s e e a l i s t o f a l l c o m m a n d s a l o n g w i t h t h e i r s h o r t c u t , d o n ’ t t y p e a ny t h i n g i n t o t h e p ro m p t. T h e a r row ke ys
will move up and down the list, and Return will activate the command.
```
```
Search in the command palette is fuzzy, so you can type part of the word to get matches. For example, you
can use trm to search for “Toggle read mode”.

##### Audio recorder

Audio recorder is a plugin that lets you make a recording without leaving Obsidian. It’s useful for class and
meeting notes when you can’t catch up for some reason, or for recording important discussions so you don’t
miss any details.

To u s e , s i m p l y c l i c k o n t h e m i c ro p h o n e i c o n i n t h e l e f t p a n e l 

![[Pasted image 8.png]]

The microphone will become colored while it’s actively recording.

Click on it again to finish recording. The audio file is now saved in your [[vault]] and an embed the recording will
be added to the end of your current note.

##### Open in default app


Opens the current file with default app on your computer. You can access it at the top right corner of the file top
bar

![[Pasted image 5.png]]

It’s useful for editing images or annotating PDFs, among other things.

### User interface

##### Workspace

Title bar

Title bar is the bar at the very top of Obsidian.

### Window title

The window title, which is the text at the very center of the title bar, indicates the name of the current vault, as
well as the current version number.

### Navigation

At the left end of the title bar, there are two arrow buttons that let you go back and forward. Because how
common they are used, we recommend using the hotkeys instead.

### Window management

At the right end of the title bar, you have the buttons to

```
Minimize the window;
```
```
Maximize the window if it’s not maximized, or restore previous size if maximized;
```
```
Close the window.
```
### Native title bar

The title bar in Obsidian is custom-built and may not have feature parity with the native title bar that you’re used
to on your operating system.

Currently you can’t disable the custom title bar. If it would be helpful to you, consider echoing your voice in this
feature request.

Workspace

The workspace in [Obsidian] contains the follow components

```
[Title bar]
[[SidebarSidebars]]
```

```
[[Sidebar#PanesSidebar panes]]
[[Sidebar#TabsSidebar tabs]]
[Ribbon] (left sidebar only)
```
```
[[Pane layoutPanes]]
```
```
[Status bar]
```
Sidebar

Obsidian has two sidebars on both left and right. The left sidebar includes the [Ribbon].

## Open hidden sidebars

If a sidebar collapsed, you can open it by clicking on the Arrow icon to expand it.

This commonly happens when you enable a plugin but cannot find it anywhere–chances are the new pane
created by the plugin is hidden in one of the sidebars. So be sure to check there!

## Ta b s

By default, plugins will only create new tabs instead of new [[#Panes]].

You can switch between tabs by clicking on the icon. A tooltip will also appear to help you identify tabs.

In each pane, you can only see one tab at every given moment. Some actions will automatically bring a tab into
view, for example when you click on a tag.

### Close tabs

Some tabs can be closed via the right click menu, but some cannot be closed. If you don’t want to see it,
consider disable the relevant plugin or collapse the sidebar by clicking on the Arrow icon.

### Rearrange tabs

As of July 2021, there’s no way to rearrange the tabs. If you’d find this handy, echo your voice in this feature
request.

## Panes

You can have multiple panes in the sidebar.

### Create panes

To g e t a n e w p a n e , d r a g t h e i c o n o f a t a b t o a b ove o r b e l ow a c u r re n t p a n e. T h e h i g h l i g h t e d a re a w i l l i n d i c a t e
where the new pane will be created.


### Close panes

To c l o s e a p a n e , yo u c a n [[#Close tabsclose all tabs in it]], or drag all tabs in it by their icons and drop them into
an existing pane.

When only the tab area of a pane is highlighted, the tab being dragged will be dropped into that pane to merge
with other tabs in that pane.

Status bar

The status bar shows handy information. That include helpful information about the current file, the current vault,
or the current status like time and date.

Status items are added both by [[Core pluginscore plugins]] and [community plugins].

Some items are interactive but some are purely informational. For example, the [Word count] plugin adds the
word and character count that’s not clickable, and the [[Obsidian SyncSync plugin]] adds an icon that both
shows the sync status as well as shows the sync log upon being clicked.

Panes

Pane layout

One of the things that makes [Obsidian] different from other note-taking apps is how easy it is to open multiple
files in your preferred configuration.

The window a file gets opened in is what we call a “pane”. You can have as many panes as you like.

### Open new panes

##### Open links

In general, you can click a link to a file while holding Ctrl (on Windows and Linux) or Cmd (on macOS) to open it
in a new pane. This includes clicking on files in [File explorer], [Search] results, [Backlinks], [Graph view], etc.

The only notable exception is in the editor. Because in the editor, a single click edits the link text rather than
following it, CtrlCmd-Click is used to follow the link. Therefore, you’ll need to hold Shift in addition to
CtrlCmd in order to open the link in a new pane.

##### Split current pane

You can also use the “More options” menu option of a pane to selec t “Split ver tically” or “Split horizontally” to
open two copies of that file.

##### Open linked views

Some options in the “More options” menu will also open a new pane that’s linked to the current pane, such as
“Open backlinks” and “Open local graph”.


### Rearrange panes

To m ove a p a n e , s i m p l y d r a g t h e p a n e i c o n i n t h e t o p l e f t c o r n e r o f t h e p a n e. A s yo u d r a g i t a ro u n d , a v i s u a l
indicator will appear to show where the pane will be placed. Dropping onto each of the four sides of an existing
pane creates a horizontal or vertical split, and dropping in the center swaps positions with the target pane.

You can also drag panes into the two sidebars. Panes in the sidebar work a bit differently, for more please see
the [[#Panes in the sidebar]] section below.

### Panes in the sidebar

There are some differences with panes that live in the [[Sidebarsidebars]].

##### Sidebar panes can share space with tabs

When your drop a pane onto a sidebar pane, a new tab will be created under that sidebar section. Different
panes in the same sidebar section can be accessed by clicking on its tab icon.

##### Sidebar panes do not show titles

This reduces clutter, but also means it’s best to keep one or two important files like a scratch pad or the daily
note for quick access, rather than having a dozen files open.

To s e e t h e t i t l e o f a f i l e t h a t ’s i n t h e s i d e b a r, h ove r ove r i t s t a b i c o n.

##### Sidebar can be easily collapsed

If there are panes that you only need to look at from time to time, having them in the sidebar makes it really easy
to toggle them with a hotkey or command.

##### To g g l e e d i t o r a n d p r e v i e w i n s i d e b a r

The hotkey to toggle between editor and preview only works in the main workspace. In the sidebar, you’ll need to
right click on the tab icon and select “Preview” or “Edit” to toggle between two modes.

### Save and load pane layouts

The [Workspaces] plugin makes it easy to come back to a particular pane layout. Give it a try!

Linked pane

Panes can be linked together. This has two main effects

```
By default, when opening a new [[Preview and edit modespreview pane]] from an editing pane, the new
pane is linked to the old one. This means that any changes you make in the editor will show up in the
preview in real time. It also means that scrolling one will scroll the other.
```

```
When a new [[Working with backlinksBacklink Pane]] is created from a note, it will be linked to that note.
This means that [backlinks] will always be shown for the note that is in that pane. This is useful if you want
to reference a set of [backlinks] but let the regular backlink panel change with whatever other note you are
working on.
```
Linked panes will be marked with a link icon. You can hover the link to see which pane it’s linked to, or click the
icon to release it, so that they are no longer linked. This will not close the previously-linked pane.

Ribbon

The ribbon is a space for common commands that occupies the vertical space at the very left of the interface.
It’s part of the left [Sidebar] and is always visible, even if the left sidebar is closed.

## Actions

Each action is presented by an icon in the ribbon. Hovering them will present a tooltip; clicking or tapping them
will activate the action.

The top ones are added by plugins, both [[Core pluginscore plugins]] and [community plugins].

The bottom three actions are Obsidian system actions to

```
1. Open another vault;
```
```
2. Get help (opens [[help vault]] on the [[desktop app]] and opens [[online help]] in the [[Obsidian
Mobilemobile app]]);
```
```
3. Open settings.
```
##### Vault switcher

Vault switcher lets you switching between existing vaults and create new vaults.

## Open vault switcher

To o p e n t h e va u l t sw i t c h e r, c l i c k o n t h e va u l t i c o n a t t h e b o t t o m g ro u p o f t h e [Ribbon] actions. The tooltip text
should say “Open another vault”.

You can see the [[#current vault list]] and [[#create new vaults]] here. Because this is the first screen new users
see, it also displays name of the program and the [current version], along with a dropdown to switch [Interface
language].

## Current vault list

On the left side of the vault switcher, you can see all the vaults you have accessed before on this device. For
each vault, you can see the name of that vault (which is the name of the vault folder), and the path to that folder.

Clicking on a vault in this list will open that vault. The cross icon lets you delete the vault from this list.


```
Note deleting a vault from this list will not delete the vault folder from your device. It will be “forgotten”
and removed from the list.
```
## Create new vaults

Vaults can be created in two ways

```
1. Choose “Create new vault” and enter the name of the vault along with where it will be stored. Essentially
Obsidian creates an empty folder in that location and open it as a vault for you;
```
```
2. Choose “Open folder as vault” and select a folder on your device. This is the recommended method if you
already have a backup or exported folder of Markdown files.
```
```
1. meaningful! ↩
```
```
2. Here’s one with multiple paragraphs and code.
```
```
Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.
```
```

```
```
Add as many paragraphs as you like.
md You can also use inline footnotes. ^[notice that the carat goes outside of the
brackets on this one.] You can also use inline footnotes. ^[notice that the carat goes outside of the
